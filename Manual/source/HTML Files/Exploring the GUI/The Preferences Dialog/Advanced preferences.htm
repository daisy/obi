<p>The Advance tab of the Preferences dialog enables you to configure profiles for Obi. There are two types of profiles: the preferences profile and the shortcuts profile. The shortcuts profile contains the list of shortcuts to be used for various operations (keyboard shortcut preferences), while the preferences profile contains configurations of all other preferences; namely, project, audio, user profile, and color.</p>

<p>Let’s understand the process of loading the profile with an example. The following steps show how to load the Advanced preferences profile.
<ol><li>In the group of radio buttons, select Preferences.</li>
<li>From the Select profile combo box, select Advanced.</li>
<li>Check the checkboxes pertinent to the preferences you wish to load. For example, if you want to load only the project preferences, check the checkbox Project.</li>
<li>Click on the Load button to start loading the preferences.</li>
</ol>
Once Obi loads the selected preferences profile, its name will be shown in the Current profile text box.
</p>
 
<p>Now if you wish to save the current preference settings as a custom profile, do the following:
<ol><li>Click on the Save button. The Save As dialog will be displayed.</li>
<li>Browse for a location where you want to save your custom profile.</li>
<li>Enter a suitable name for the profile file.</li>
<li>Click save.</li>
</ol>
 Obi will save the current preference settings in the XML file specified by you.
</p>

<p>Next, we will look at the process of assigning the profiles to the <b>Switch Profile</b> button of Recording Toolbar. Let’s suppose you wish to assign the “Basic” and “Advanced” profiles to the button.
<ol><li>In the Assign audio profiles to Recording Toolbar group box, select “Basic” from the first combo box.</li>
<li>Now, select “Advanced” from the second combo box.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Assign</b> button.</li>
</ol>
The Basic and Advanced profiles will be assigned to the Switch Profile button of the Recording Toolbar, which will toggle with each click and show <b>Switch from Basic to Advanced</b> and <b>Switch from Advanced to Basic</b> alternatively.
