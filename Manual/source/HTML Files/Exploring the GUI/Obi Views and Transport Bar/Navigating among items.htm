<li>To move to the next section, press <b>Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow</b> and to move to the previous section, press <b>Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>If you are at a section label, to move to the first phrase of the section, press <b>Right Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>If you are currently at a phrase or phrase separator, press <b>Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow</b> to move to the section label. Pressing <b>Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow</b> will take you to the section label of the section below.</li>
<li>You can move to the next phrase by pressing <b>Right Arrow</b> and to the previous phrase by using the <b>Left Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>To move to a phrase separator after the current phrase, press <b>Ctrl+Right Arrow</b>. Similarly, to move to a phrase separator before the current phrase, press <b>Ctrl+Left Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>When you are currently on a phrase separator, to move to the next one, press <b>Ctrl+Right Arrow</b>, and to move to a previous one, press <b>Ctrl+Left Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>To move to a phrase before the current phrase separator, press <b>Left Arrow</b>. To move to a phrase after the current phrase separator, press <b>Right Arrow</b>.</li>
<li>To move to the first phrase of the section, press <b>Home</b>, and to move to the last phrase of the section, press <b>End</b>.</li>
<li>Use <b>Up Arrow</b> to move to the first phrase of the preceding row and <b>Down Arrow</b> to move to the first phrase in the row below.</li>
<li>Press <b>Page Up</b> to move up one screen, and <b>Page Down</b> to move down one screen.</li>
<li>Press <b>Ctrl+Page Down</b> to move to the next page phrase, and <b>Ctrl+Page Up</b> to move to the previous page phrase.</li>
<li>You can move to a phrase holding a special role after the current phrase by pressing <b>F4</b>. To move to a phrase with a special role before the current phrase, press <b>Shift+F4</b>.</li>
<li>To move to the next Todo phrase, press <b>Ctrl+F9</b>, and to move to the Todo phrase before the current phrase, press <b>Ctrl+Shift+F9</b>.</li>
<li>To move to the next empty phrase in the project, press <b>Ctrl+Alt+F4</b>.</li>
</ul></p>
 
<p>You may also traverse all the phrases of the section one by one using the keystrokes Tab or Shift+Tab.</p>

<p>For example: 
<br>If you are at the section label, pressing Tab will take you to the first phrase. If you press Tab again, the keyboard focus will move to the second phrase. Now if there are only two phrases in the section, this keystroke will take you to the section label again.
<br>Conversely, the keystrokes Shift+Tab will move you backward in the section. This means, it will move to the first phrase from the second one, and then to the section label.</p>

<p>If the <a href="../../Creating a DTB/Working with Audio/Play on Navigaye.htm">Play on navigate</a> option is turned on, Obi starts the playback of the item that receives the focus.</p>
