<h1><a name="top"></a>Recording toolbar</h1>

<p>Recording toolbar is devised to facilitate book narrators to record the contents displayed on their computer screen conveniently. It provides an exhaustive set of controls required for recording book contents and marking structure at the same time.</p>

<p>It is not a component of the application window, but is a vital tool of Obi. Its miniature appearance is deliberated to leave maximum space for the resource being read. The figure below illustrates how the Recording toolbar looks.</p>

<p>Recording toolbar can be magnified or shrunk for touch screen use. The <b>Enlarge</b> button magnifies the toolbar and the <b>Reduce</b> button shrinks it. But please note that the toolbar cannot be made shorter than the default size.</p>

<p>Other controls of the Recording toolbar are mapped to the functions required to perform recording and structure markup, and are categorized in the following topics:
<ul><li>Audio controls</li>
<li>Navigation and Mark-up Controls</li>
</ul></p>
 
<p>Recording toolbar can be in any of the following states:
<ul><li>Idle: No operation is taking place.</li>
<li>Playing: Playback is in progress</li>
<li>Monitoring/Recording: Audio monitoring/recording is in progress.</li>
</ul>
 
<p><h2>Show/Hide Recording toolbar</h2>
The Recording toolbar can be shown or hidden by selecting <b>View->Show Recording toolbar</b> from the menu or pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+R</b>. Once shown, the Recording Toolbar will remain on the top of all other windows to ensure comfortable narration.</p>

<p>By default, Obi’s application window minimizes with the activation of Recording Toolbar, but you can alter this behavior by checking the checkbox <b>Do not minimize Obi with activation of Recording Toolbar</b> in the <a href="../The Preferences Dialog/project preferences.htm">Project</a> tab of the Preferences dialog.

<p>Please note that Obi opens Graphical Peak Meter automatically with the initiation of the Recording toolbar.</p>
