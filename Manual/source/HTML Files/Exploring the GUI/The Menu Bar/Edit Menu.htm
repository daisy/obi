<p>Edit menu allows you to perform the edit operations in Obi, like undo previous changes, redo the undone changes, cut, copy, paste and delete an item such as section, phrase, audio and text. It also provides commands to set a bookmark or navigate to it. Besides this, it facilitates searching for an item.</p>
