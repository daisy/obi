<a name="top"></a><h1>View Menu</h1>

<p>View menu provides commands for bringing a view in or out of focus, adjusting magnitude parameters or viewing properties, etc.</p>

<p>The application window of Obi is highly configurable. All the views, except the Content view, can be shown or hidden by simple commands. These commands are organized in the View menu. The check box in the beginning of the menu item indicates whether the respective view is visible or not. If the check box is checked, the view is visible; otherwise, it is hidden. Plus, there are some commands to shift the keyboard focus to TOC view, Content view and Transport bar. The View menu also provides commands to magnify or shrink the text and graphics of various views.</p>

<p>For a detailed information on various views, see <a href="../Obi Views and Transport Bar/Obi Views and Transport Bar.htm">Obi's Views and Control Bars</a>.</p>
