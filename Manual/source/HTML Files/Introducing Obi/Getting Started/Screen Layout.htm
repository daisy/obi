<a name="top"></a><h1>Screen Layout</h1>
<p>Obi has a meticulously designed screen that helps you manage the contents of the book in a structured and efficient way.</p>

<p>The Obi screen is divided into various segments, which are separated by splitters. They are:
<ul><li><a href="#toc_view">TOC View</a></li>
<li><a href="#content_view">Content View</a></li>
<li><a href="#metadata_view">Metadata View</a></li>
<li><a href="#transport_bar">Transport Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="#status_bar">Status Bar</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>When you open a project in Obi, all the views, except the Metadata view, are visible. These views can be shown or hidden by using the menu bar or keyboard shortcuts, except for the Content View. The Content View is always visible.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates how Obi screen looks:</p>

<li><a href="#source_view">Source View</a></li>
 </ul></p>

<p><a name="graphical_peak_meter"></a><h3>Graphical Peak Meter</h3>

<p><a name="source_view"></a><h3>Source View</h3>
