<h2 id="top">New in Obi 5.0</h2>

<p>Obi 5.0 upgrades Obi to .NET 6 framework for keeping it abreast with the new technologies. While the main focus was on upgradation, the new version also comes with some enhancements to the To-Do functionality, like highlighting cursor at the To-Do position when it is applied, showing To-Do mark position time in Special phrase list dialog and adding To-Do comments in the CSV export.</p>
<p>Version 5.0  will work on Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11. Please use version 4.8 for Windows Vista.</b>


<h3>Highlights of Obi 5.0  release</h3>

<p><a href="#profiles_import">Implemented import of preferences profiles created in .NET 4 based versions</a></p>
<p><a href="#TODO">Enhanced to the To-Do functionality</a></p>
<p><a href="#GOTO">Go To dialog now accepts time in HH:MM:SS format</a></p>

<h4 id="profiles_import">Implemented import of preferences profiles created in .NET 4 based versions</h4>
The new Obi creates preferences files in a little different format than .NET 4 based Obi versions. Therefore, a module for importing old .NET 4 based preferences profiles has been implemented for ensuring seamless import of your existing profiles.

<h4 id="TODO">Enhanced to the To-Do functionality</h4>
The following enhancements have been implemented:
<ul>
<li>When To-Do mark is applied, the position in the waveform is highlighted. Consequently, the playback is also paused.</li>
<li>The Special phrase list dialog now also shows the time of the To-Do mark position.</li>
<li>To-Do comments are included in the CSV export.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="GOTO">Go To dialog now accepts time in HH:MM:SS format</h4>
Go to time features used to accept time in seconds and milliseconds. Now it also accepts time in HH:MM:SS format, for making it more user friendly.
