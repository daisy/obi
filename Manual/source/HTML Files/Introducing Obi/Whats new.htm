<h4 id="NET9_Upgrade">Upgradation to .NET 9 Framework</h4>
Obi has been upgraded to the .NET 9 framework to ensure compatibility with the latest technologies. This upgrade also brings several improvements, including reduced startup time, improved user interface responsiveness, and better memory management.

<h4 id="TODO_Behaviour">Added Option for Specialized To-Do Behaviour</h4>
A specialized To-Do behaviour has been added to allow the creation of a small To-Do phrase while recording. This helps users easily identify and check for minor recording glitches.

To enable this feature, select the <b>Create a small phrase when TODO is marked while recording</b> checkbox in <a href="../Exploring the GUI/The Preferences Dialog/Audio Preferences.htm">Audio Preferences</a>.


<h4 id="CSV_Import">CSV Import Now Supports Section Names with Commas</h4>
CSV import now supports section names that contain commas. To use this feature, encapsulate the section name within double quotes. For example, if the section name is: Chapter 1, Section Name,  it should be written in the CSV file as: "Chapter 1, Section Name".

<h4 id="Efficiency_Improvement">Improved Efficiency and stability</h4>
Performance improvements have been made to improve overall efficiency and reduce performance-related issues. These enhancements result in smoother navigation and improved overall stability of Obi.
