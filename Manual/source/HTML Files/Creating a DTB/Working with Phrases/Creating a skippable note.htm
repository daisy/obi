<p>There are various types of skippable notes but all of them are created using the same process. The following steps exemplify the process of creating a skippable note of annotation type using context menu and keyboard shortcuts. You may also use the commands listed in the submenu of <b>Phrases->Skippable note…</b>, which are similar to those listed in the submenu of Skippable notes in the context menu.
<ol><li>Use the arrow keys or mouse click to land on the phrase from where annotation should begin.</li>
<li>Right click on the phrase or press the applications key on the keyboard to invoke the context menu and select <b>Skippable notes->Begin note</b> therein. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key combination <b>Ctrl+Alt+[</b>. This will mark the beginning of the annotation.</li>
<li>Go to the last phrase to be included in the annotation. If this is also the last phrase of the section, you can simply press the shortcut key <b>End</b> to reach there.</li>
<li>Select <b>Skippable notes->End note</b> from the context menu or press <b>Ctrl+Alt+]</b> to mark the end of annotation. An Assign note dialog opens as shown in the figure below.</li>

 <li>Choose annotation from the combo box.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>OK</b> button or press <b>Enter</b> to classify the selected set of phrases as annotation.</li>
</ol></p> 

<p>All the phrases selected in the range will be tagged as annotation and will be included in the list of skippable notes of your project. Once created, the skippable note can be associated with any phrase of the project as described in <a href="Associating Skippable Note with Anchor.htm">Associating Skippable Note to Anchor</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that you can mark the beginning and end of a skippable note on the same phrase also.</p>
