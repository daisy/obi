<h1>Walkthrough 5: Generate a DAISY book from pre-recorded audio by an
automated process</h1>

<p>Obi empowers you to produce a DAISY DTB from pre-recorded content in few
simple steps using an automated process. This will be greatly beneficial in
scenarios where you do not wish to disturb the existing workflow of recording
audio. Moreover, it will cut down on the time and resources required to work on
Obi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>How it
works?</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>While importing audio files, Obi gathers information
regarding the naming conventions of the audio files from the users to parse the
file names, which is used to create sections, pages, and placing audio. Also,
if the files are ordered using a numeric prefix, they can be sorted in
ascending order by just a click of a button; though you can do manual ordering
of the files to ensure that they appear in the correct order. Furthermore, the
imported audio can be split automatically at the positions determined by the
phrase detection algorithm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Step by Step Process</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To get you started, one of the methods of producing a
navigable DAISY book is described here. You can do alterations in it to suit
your working style. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 1: Work on the audio files</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before starting the process, you must make sure that you
have complete audio of the book in the audio files adhering to the following
rules: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The files should be in MP3 or WAV format. Do not bother
     about the channels and sampling rate as Obi will take care of them while
     importing. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The files should be ordered by prefixing numeric
     characters, such as “001”. If you skip this step, you will have to do
     manual ordering while importing. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The audio of each chapter/section should be stored in a
     separate file. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The name of the audio file should contain the section name
     exactly as it appears in the book, though the characters like “_” can be
     used instead of the space character; for example,
     “011_Hope_is_not_far.wav”. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If the audio content of each page is stored separately,
     the file names should contain a page identification string, such as
     “Page”, followed by the respective page number; for instance, “Page_012”. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If the chapter/section spans multiple pages, only the name
     of the first file should contain the section name. The subsequent files
     should carry the page identification string and the page numbers only; or
     else, Obi will create a separate section for each one of them. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following is the snippet of the audio file names containing pre-recorded
audio content of the book “The Dawn”.<br>
001_The_Dawn.wav<br>
002_Contents.wav<br>
003_Acknowledgements_Page_006.wav<br>
004_Introduction_Page_007.wav<br>
005_Page_008.wav<br>
006_Page 009.wav</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the example above, the files are ordered by numeric prefixes that will
ensure automatic ordering. These files also use “_” in place of the space
character, which will be rectified during the import process. Also note that
the file “004_Introduction_Page_007.wav” carries the section name, and thus its
audio content will be placed in the section named “Introduction Page 007”. The
subsequent files do not carry the section name, and therefore, Obi will not create
a separate section for them but append their contents to the previous section;
“Introduction Page 007” in this case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will use this example to show how the automated book production process
works.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a new project</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To produce a DAISY DTB, we should create a project first.
Follow the instructions below to create a new project in Obi: </p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Launch Obi by clicking <b>All Programs-&gt;Obi-&gt;Obi x.x</b>
     on the Start menu. You may also double click on the Obi icon on the
     desktop. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click on the <b>Create a new project</b> button in the
     Welcome dialog. The New project dialog appears. <br>
     <img width=795 height=267 id="Picture 1"
     src="Walkthrough%205_files/image001.jpg" alt="New Project dialog"></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In the <b>Title</b> edit box, key-in the name of the
     publication; “The Dawn” in the example above. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Check the check box <b>Automatically create a title
     section with this title</b>. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Enter the unique identifier for the publication in the <b>ID</b>
     field. You may also use the <b>Generate</b> button to generate an
     identifier automatically. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Specify the location where the project should be created
     in the <b>Location</b> edit box. You may also browse for a location using
     the <b>Select</b> button. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click on the <b>OK</b> button. A dialog box appears
     enabling you to select the audio settings for the project. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Select the sample rate for the audio of the project from
     the first combo box; higher values ensure better quality but consume more
     disk space. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Select the desired audio channels for the project, mono or
     stereo, from the second combo box. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click on the <b>OK</b> button. </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi creates a new project in the specified location and displays it in the
application window. The title of the project is also shown in the title bar of
Obi; “The Dawn” in our example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step3: Import the audio content</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will import the audio from the pre-recorded files.
At the same time, we will provide information that will be used for parsing and
refining the file names to create sections and pages. If the files are ordered
using numeric prefixes, they can be sorted via the Ascending order button;
otherwise we should do manual ordering in the Import audio files dialog.
Additionally, we can instruct Obi to split the imported audio using the phrase
detection algorithm that will make the DTB navigable at the phrase level. </p>

<p>Follow the instructions below to import the audio content and create the
structure of the book. </p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Move the focus to the Content view by pressing <b>F6</b>. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Press <b>Ctrl+I</b>. Obi displays the dialog box to browse
     for the audio files. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Select all the audio files pertaining to your book and
     click <b>Open</b>. Obi opens the Import audio files dialog. <br>
     The first list box exhibits the selected audio files. Check the list
     thoroughly for ensuring completeness of the audio content. </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=368 height=540 id="Picture 6"
src="Walkthrough%205_files/image002.jpg"></p>

<ol start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If you missed out some files, they can be augmented to the
     list via the <b>Add</b> button. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>You can also remove redundant files by selecting them in
     the list and clicking on the <b>Remove</b> button. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>To sort the files in ascending order, click on the <b>Ascending
     order</b> button. If the files do not carry numeric ordering prefix, they
     can be shifted up or down in the list by using the <b>Move up</b> and <b>Move
     down</b> buttons. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Check the check box <b>Create a section for each audio
     file</b>. This will enable three more controls described ahead. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In the edit box <b>To replace with space</b>, enter the
     character used instead of the space character in the audio file names. In
     our example, this character is “_”. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We should remove the numeric ordering prefix from the
     audio file names to correct the section name. Specify the number of
     characters to be removed from the beginning of the audio file name in the
     numeric edit box <b>Number of initial chars to trim</b>; this will be the
     length of the numeric prefix. In our example, we will enter the number 4. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In the edit box Page identification, enter the string that
     represents page; “Page” in our example. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Finally, select the radio button <b>Phrase detection on
     imported files</b> that will instruct Obi to split the imported audio
     using the phrase detection algorithm. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click on the <b>OK</b> button. Obi will display the Phrase
     detection settings dialog showing the parameters to be used for detecting
     split points for phrases. These parameters are extracted from the Audio
     tab of the Preferences dialog. You may modify them if they do not
     represent the audio of silence of the room where the files were recorded. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click <b>OK</b> to start importing. </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi may take several minutes to process the audio content. After completion,
the application window will start displaying the imported content structured in
sections. If the book does not have a flat structure, you will have to adjust
the levels of the sections by moving them left or right in the TOC view using
the commands for increasing and decreasing the level of sections. For more
help, refer to <a
href="../../Creating%20a%20DTB/Working%20with%20Sections/Changing%20the%20level%20of%20a%20section.htm">Changing
the levels of a section</a>.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=846 height=289 id="Picture 4"
src="Walkthrough%205_files/image003.jpg"></p>

<p>Obi will create a section for each file carrying the section name. The
contents of the page audio files will be appended to the prior section. The
page audio files are the files that bear the page identification string and the
respective page number, but not the section name. If the audio file name
contained alphabets other than the page identification string, as in the file
name “003_Acknowledgements_Page_006.wav”, it will be treated as a normal audio
file and not a page audio file. Therefore, Obi will create a separate section
for it and place its audio content under the section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi will do the following to the snippet of our example.</p>

<p>“The Dawn” will become the first section of the project.</p>

<p>“Contents” will become the second section of the project.</p>

<p>“Acknowledgements Page 006” will become the third section having the page
phrase numbered 6 at the end.</p>

<p>“Introduction Page 007” will become the fourth section containing the audio
content of the file “004_Introduction_Page_007.wav” as well as the page phrase
numbered 7, the contents of the audio file “005_Page_008.wav”, followed by the
page phrase numbered 8, the audio content of the file named “006_Page 009.wav”,
followed by the page phrase numbered 9.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that after this process, you may find that the title section,
present earlier, no longer exists. This will happen in the case when the name
of the first audio file is different from that of the title of the project, as
Obi will replace the title section with the section from the first audio file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 4: Export to a DAISY DTB</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, we should export the project to a DAISY DTB as
follows: </p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Press <b>Ctrl+E</b>. The DAISY standard selection dialog
     appears. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Select the DAISY standard to which the exported DTB should
     conform, and click OK. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The Export dialog will be displayed, showing the path of
     the default export directory. You may change it if you wish to store the
     exported DTB somewhere else. There are some other parameters that can be
     enabled for exported files. For more help, see the topic <a
     href="../../Creating%20a%20DTB/Exporting%20and%20Validating%20DTB/Exporting%20as%20DAISY%20DTB.htm">Exporting
     as DAISY DTB</a>. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click on the OK button to start the export. </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project will be exported to a DAISY DTB and stored in the directory
specified in the Export dialog. With this, your DTB is ready. But before
distribution, you must ensure that it is valid as per DAISY standard. To
validate the exported DTB, do any of the following: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click <b>Tools-&gt;DAISY 3 Validator</b> for assuring
     compliance with DAISY 3 standard. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Click <b>Tools-&gt;DAISY 2.02 Light Validator</b> for
     assuring compliance with DAISY 2.02 standard. </li>
</ul>
