<a name="speech_rate"></a> <p><h2>Speech Rate</h2>
Increases/Decreases the rate at which audio is played. Follow the steps listed below to increase/decrease the speech rate of audio contained in a phrase: 
<ol><li>Select a section or a phrase. You can also select a <a href="../Working with Phrases/Executing commands on multiple phrases.htm">range of phrases</a>.</li>

</ol></p>

<a name="noise_reduction"></a> <p><h2>Noise Reduction</h2>
Reduces noise from the audio content of the phrase. Noise is any unwanted sound that is recorded into the phrase while recording, like the humming sound from the laptop, sound from the air-conditioner, etc. This functionality lets you set the noise floor and the frequency to which the noise should be reduced. The process is explained in the following steps:
<ol><li>Select a section or a phrase. You can also select a <a href="../Working with Phrases/Executing commands on multiple phrases.htm">range of phrases</a>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Tools->Audio Processing->Noise Reduction</b> on the menu or press <b>Ctrl+Shift+Y</b>. You will be presented by a dialog box as shown below.</li>
 <p><img src="../../images/audio_processing_noise_reduction_dialog.png" alt="Noise Reduction Dialog"/></p>
<li>The combo box Background noise level gives you three options to remove noise: strong, medium, and weak. For example, you should choose to remove weak noise if the recording has a very weak noise like the hum of the laptop in the background. The rest of the parameters in the dialog will be adjusted automatically depending on your selection. This is done especially to facilitate new users. Experienced users can further customize the parameters as follows:
<ol type="a"><li>You can set the noise floor using the Noise Level trackbar or edit box. Noise floor is given in percentages.</li>
<li>The Noise reduction trackbar and edit box help you specify by how many decibels should the noise be reduced. If you want to apply high suppression, then you should be careful that it does not suppress the voice of speaker along with the noise.</li></li></ol>
<li>If you wish to apply the noise reduction feature on the entire audio of the book, check the checkbox <b>Apply on whole book</b>.</li>
<li>Click OK to invoke the noise reduction functionality or Cancel to cancel the operation.</li>
</ol></p>

<a name="audio_mixer"></a> <p><h2>Audio Mixer</h2>
Mixes audio from external file(s) with audio of selected phrase. It is very useful for the scenarios where you wish to add a background music to the audio content of the phrase. You can mix audio from 2 external files with audio of the phrase at a time using this functionality. The process is described as follows:
<ol><li>Select a phrase.</li>
<li>Click <b>Tools->Audio Processing->Audio Mixer</b> on the menu or press <b>Ctrl+Shift+X</b>. You will be presented with a dialog box as shown below.</li>
 <p><img src="../../images/audio_processing_audio_mixer_dialog.png" alt="Audio Mixer Dialog"/></p>
<li>Click the <b>browse</b> button next to the edit box <b>Select audio for mixing</b>, and select the external file containing the audio content to be mixed.</li>
<li>Specify the volume for audio from the external file in the edit box <b>Weight of Audio</b>. The value 1.0 denotes the original volume. You can choose to decrease the volume of the audio content from external file by specifying values less than 1.</li>
<li>If you wish to mix audio from any other file simultaneously, check the check box <b>Select second audio for mixing</b>. This will enable the edit boxes to enter the file path and the weight of the audio to be imported.</li>
<li>If you want that the volume of audio being mixed returns to initial weight (1.0) a few seconds after the duration of original phrase, you can do so by entering the time in the edit box Drop out transition. For example, if the duration of original phrase was 5 seconds, the audio being mixed was 15 seconds, and you specified the drop out transition to be 2 seconds, the initial volume of the audio being mixed will be resumed after 7 seconds from the beginning of the phrase.</li>
<li>By default, the resulting phrase after mixing will be of the maximum duration of the audio contents being mixed. You can limit it to the original phrase size by checking the check box Set end of stream duration to the phrase duration.</li>
<li>You may also specify the duration of the audio content from the external files to be retained after the duration of the original phrase. Check the check box Set duration of mixing audio after phrase ends and enter the duration in seconds for which the audio content from the external files should be retained. For example, if the original phrase is of 5 seconds and you want to retain audio from external file for 2 more seconds, specify 2 in the edit box. The resulting phrase will now be of 7 seconds.</li>
<li>Click OK to start audio mixing or press Cancel to cancel the operation.</li>
