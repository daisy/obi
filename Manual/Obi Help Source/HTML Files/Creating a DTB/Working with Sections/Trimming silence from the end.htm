<p>Sometimes there is a trailing silence at the end of section, which is undesirable as the book reader will hear an unnecessary lag. Obi enables you to delete the trailing silence from the sections using this operation quickly and neatly. This functionality is provided in the Trim silence from the section end menu item under Sections menu. It lists the following commands:
<ul>
<li><b>Delete silence from end of section</b>: Finds the trailing silence at the end of the selected section and removes it from the project.</li>
<li><b>Retain silence in last phrase of section</b>: Finds trailing silence at the end of the selected section, removes it, and saves it as the last phrase of the section. Editors can then inspect this phrase to ensure if there is nothing important before deleting it from the project.</li>
<li><b>Delete silence from end of all sections</b>: Removes trailing silence from the end of all sections of the project.</li>
<li><b>Retain silence in the last phrase of all sections</b>: Finds trailing silence from all the sections of the project and saves them as last phrases of the respective sections.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The following list exemplifies how to execute these commands:
<ol>
<li>Select a section.</li>
<li>Click <b>Sections->Trim silence from the section end->Delete silence from end of section</b> on the menu.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>These commands can also be applied using the <a href="Multi-section operations.htm">Multi-sections Operations dialog</a> for particular sections.</p>
