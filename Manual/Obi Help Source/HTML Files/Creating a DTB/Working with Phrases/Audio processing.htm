<p>Obi enables you to perform audio processing, such as normalization, amplification, etc., on the selected item. Please note that this feature is in the preliminary stage currently, and will be enhanced in the future by using professional plug-ins (like VST) in the backend.</p>

<p>The audio processing functions supported by Obi are:
<ul>li>Amplify: Increase or decrease the volume of the audio contained in the selected item by a specified rate.</li>
<li>Normalize: Apply the constant amount of gain to the audio of the selected item so that the average and peak amplitudes are within the threshold of the audio file.</li>
<li>Speech rate: Compress or expand the audio content, to increase or decrease the rate at which it is played, by the specified times.</li>
 </ul></p>

<p>Follow the steps listed below to perform audio processing:
<ol><li>Select a section or a phrase. You can also select a range of phrases as described after these steps.</li>
<li>Click <b>Tools->Audio Processing</b> on the menu. The Audio Processing dialog will appear.</li>
<p><img src="../../images/audioprocessing.png" alt="Audio Processing dialog"/></p>
<li>Select the function you wish to apply on the audio of the selected item from the combo box <b>Process</b>.</li>
<li>In the edit box <b>Set Parameter</b>, Enter the parameter to be used for the selected audio processing function.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Obi will apply the specified audio processing function on the selected item. For example, if you selected the process as “Amplify” and entered the parameter as “2.0”, the contained audio will be amplified by 2.0 times.</p>
