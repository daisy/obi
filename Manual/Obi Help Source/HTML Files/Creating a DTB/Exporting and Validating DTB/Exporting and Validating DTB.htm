<p>This is the last step of creating an accessible book. You must ensure the following things before going further:
<ul><li>All the contents of the book have been entered correctly.</li>
<li>The structure of the book is in sync with the physical book.</li>
<li>Metadata entries are filled properly.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Now, you will have to perform an export operation to publish the DAISY/EPUB 3 book.</p>

<p>But before distribution, the contents of the DTB must be validated. Obi provides validators to check your exported DTB for compliance with DAISY/EPUB specifications.</p>
