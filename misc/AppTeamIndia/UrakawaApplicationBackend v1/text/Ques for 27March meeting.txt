some technical points to be discuss on skype meetting to be held on March 26, 2006.

1. The play method of direct sound without streaming buffer is able to play small files i.e. some seconds long, and in streaming buffer we need to refresh the buffer while playing which result in complex implementation for editing and navigating whole file, another option is to use AudioVideoPlayback which is designed to handle huge files but effects are limited like it do not have echo cancelling and noise elimination effect, at the same time it has advantage that navigation with respect to time for whole file  is very easy. 

2. For silence detection the property found  in directX is PeakLevel in Direct Play. No such property was found in direct sound or AudioVideoPlayback. But the problem of direct play is that it would be removed from directX in coming versions as a result better alternative is required.

we are currently using cooperative level as priorty so as to support bit depth of minimum 16 bits, which has a  disadvantage of using sound hardware in dedicated mode but as long as full duplex operations are not used it will not be of much concern.

4. Currently software buffers are being used which put more load on CPU but has advantage that performance of application would be  largely independent of device capability.

Any comments and suggestions would be welcomed.

sincerely
