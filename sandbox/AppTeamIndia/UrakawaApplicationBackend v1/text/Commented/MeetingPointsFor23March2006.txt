The points to be discussed in the meeting:

*The methods present in the IAssetManager.cs need to be clarified
again.  There is some confusion regarding the local asset name and get
asset methodds.
media type and sub type

*The question regarding the Interface needs to be asked.  We are
simply supposed to do the "fill in the blanks" sort of task or are we
also going to do the further task in which the implementation will be
made?

*Which kind of creation of buffers is required -
The hardware one or the  software one.  We prefer the buffers which
are located on CPU(software).

*The kind of cooperative levels for the playback and the recording
need to be decided.

Sincerely
App Team, India
