The code is written using c# 2003
It is an experimental code and not compliant to coding conventions
The code generates an form with buttons
 and text boxes as

Button Play, Button Stop
The above are for playing from an static buffer using direct sound.


Button PlayBack
Plays file using directx AudioVideoPlayBack

Button GetTime 
gets the current time of file with respect to whole file and displayes in text box next to it.

Button Jump Time
Jumps the playing position to the offset given in text box next to it (in seconds).
Note: currently this button is not taking input from textvox due to compile error so for now we have given offset of 60 seconds in program.

Button StopPlayback
Stops the playing file being played using AudioVideoPlayBack.
