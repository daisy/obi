If you want to have a look at the application, open Obi in Visual Studio 2005.
If you want to have a look at the audio backend, open
  UrakawaApplicationBackend in Visual Studio .Net 2003.

Prerequisites:
1. You will need to install Direct X .Net SDK first.
2. Once DirectX is installed, you can compile UrakawaApplicationBackend
3. You also need to compile the Urakawa toolkit from the implementation
   directory.
4. Once you have DirectX, the backend and the toolkit, you can compile Obi.
   You *may* need to specify the location of the DLLs again in the References
   section of the Solution Explorer; they can be found in the bin/ directory
   of all projects. (Sometimes, just looking at the properties of a "missing"
   reference does the trick.) 

+ Commands
  A 2003 project for the command pattern used by the application and the audio
  backend. Part of UrakawaApplicationBackend.

+ Obi
  A 2005 project for the application. This is the main project.

+ UrakawaApplicationBackend
  A 2003 project for the audio backend (player, recorder, vu meter and) and
  asset manager of the application. Includes also Commands and
  VirtualAudioBackend. This is the first version with destructive edits.
  Do not use this version.

+ VirtualAudioBackend
  A 2003 project for the audio backend, this is the second version with
  non-destructive edits and commands. Use this version. Part of
  UrakawaApplicationBackend.

+ docs
  Mostly outdated, features.txt contains the rough feature list of version
  0.5/1.0/future of the application.

+ prototype
  Contains the two prototypes/mockups that were delivered in April. Protobi
  is more interactive, UrakawaPrototype shows more features. The application
  will still look quite different. Both are 2005 projects.

+ sandbox
  Stuff.
