Obi is now a self-contained application; the asset manager and audio backend
have been included in the same project. The Obi project can then be opened
in Visual Studio 2005 and compiled/run from there. There are still some
prerequisites:

Prerequisites:
1. You will need to install Direct X .Net SDK first.
2. You also need to compile the Urakawa toolkit from the implementation
   directory.
3. Once you have DirectX and the toolkit, you can compile Obi.  You *may*
   need to specify the location of the DLLs again in the References
   section of the Solution Explorer; they can be found in the bin/ directory
   of all projects. (Sometimes, just looking at the properties of a "missing"
   reference does the trick.) 

What's where:

+ Obi
  A 2005 project for the application. This is the main project.

+ docs
  Mostly outdated, features.txt contains the rough feature list of version
  0.5/1.0/future of the application. Also some notes from the application
  team meeting in Delhi in August 2006 and initial comments for the fa√ßade
  API (facade-api.txt)

+ prototype
  Contains the two prototypes/mockups that were delivered in April. Protobi
  is more interactive, UrakawaPrototype shows more features. The application
  will still look quite different. Both are 2005 projects.

+ sandbox
  Stuff.

All the rest is old stuff (original 2003 projects for the audio backend and
asset manager) that will be moved away.
