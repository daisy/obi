About Obi

Obi is the Urakawa Project DAISY/NISO Digital Talking production tool. It is
a simple Windows application designed to create audio books with a table of
contents.

Current version of Obi is 0.8.1.0 (2007-02-24.) Please read the accompanying

Installing Obi

To install Obi, you first need to install the Microsoft .NET runtime 2.0 and
the DirectX runtime. The .NET runtime can be installed automatically by the
Obi installer, but the DirectX runtime must be installed separately. You can
download a web installer from Microsoft at the following URL:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&displaylang=en

Once the DirectX runtime is installed, simply run the installer from this
archive. The installer will also create a desktop icon and a shortcut.


Compiling Obi

Obi can be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or Microsoft Visual C#
2005 Express Edition. To compile Obi, you must first compile version 0.5 of
the Urakawa SDK (urakawa.dll) as well as the XukToZed project from the
implementation directory.
