    <div id="what">
      <h2>What is Obi?</h2>
      <p>Obi is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> <a href="#def-daisy-niso">DAISY/NISO</a> <a href="#gls_dtb">Digital Talking Book</a> (DTB) production tool.</p>
      <p class="todo">Free to use, internationalized, accessible; audio-only; DAISY 3 export, etc.</p>
      <p>Obi is being developed as part of the Urakawa project, where tools are developed to help developers build accessible multimedia applications. Please visit <a href="http://urakawa.sf.net">the Urakawa project website</a> to find out more.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="work-area">
      <h2>The work area</h2>
      <p>The image below shows the work area of Obi when a project is open. It consists of three parts: on the left-hand side is the <em>table of contents view</em>, or TOC view for short, where the table of contents for the project is shown; on the right-hand size is the <em>strips view</em> where the actual contents of the book are edited; and on the bottom is the <em>transport bar</em> that controls playback, recording and navigation of the audio in the project.</p>
      <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_mainwindow.png" alt="the main window, with the TOC tree view at the left, and the strip view at the right" /></p>
      <p class="wwwvisible"><a href="images/manual_mainwindow.png" title="full-size screenshot" rel="external"><img style="width:400px;height:269px;" src="images/manual_mainwindow.png" alt="the main window, with the TOC tree view at the left, and the strip view at the right" /></a></p>
      <div id="toc-view">
        <h3>The table of contents view</h3>
        <p>Using the TOC view you can navigate in the major structural elements of the project. Typically, this means that you move your current position to a certain section (or chapter if you will) of the DAISY <a href='#gls_dtb'>DTB</a> being recorded.</p>
        <p>The TOC View is a tree, which means that a section (a node in the tree) can have children. In DTB terminology, this feature is used to describe that a certain section is a sub-section (or a child) of another section.</p> 
        <p>The TOC View also allows section editing, such as adding and removing sections.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="strips-view">
        <h3>The strips view</h3>
        <p>The strips view contains <a href='#gls_strip'>strips</a>. A strip represents a section in the DTB. This also means that each strip in the strips view corresponds to one section in the TOC view.</p>
        <p>The strips view provides a more detailed view of the project. Here, you can navigate not only between the major sections of the book, but also at a much more detailed level, namely among the <a href='#gls_block'>blocks</a> that are contained within each strip. We will learn more about blocks later.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="transport-bar">
        <h3>The transport bar</h3>
        <p>The transport bar is used to playback the contents of the project and to record new audio. It has controls similar to those found on hardware or software audio players and recorders such as play, pause, stop, record, fast forward and rewind as well as more specific navigation options such as next phrase or previous section. The transport bar also displays time information and a text-version of the VU meter which can be picked up by screen readers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="authoring">
      <h2>Authoring in Obi</h2>
      <p>Without further ado, let's see how to use Obi to author a new project or complete a project in progress.</p>
      <div id="creating-opening">
        <h3>Creating and opening projects</h3>
        <p>A project in Obi contains all of the audio data and structure information necesary to create a DAISY/NISO books. When you start Obi for the first time, no project will be open, so you will need to create a new project, or open an existing one.
        <div>
          <h4>Creating a new project</h4>
          <p>To create a new project, select <q>New project</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or press Ctrl+N. A dialog will appear as shown below:</p>
          <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_newproject.png" alt="the new project dialog" /></p>
          <p class="wwwvisible"> <a rel="external" href="images/manual_newproject.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img style="width:400px;height:155px;" src="images/manual_newproject.png" alt="the new project dialog" /></a></p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Title</dt>
            <dd>The title of your project.</dd>
            <dt>Automatically create a title section with this title</dt>
            <dd>If you check this option, then the project will be created with a top-level section with this title. Otherwise, a completely empty project will be created.</dd>
            <dt>File</dt>
            <dd>The location on your hard drive where your project will be saved. You can type in a location or click on the <q>Select</q> button to bring the file browser and select a location.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p class="todo">Can someone do another screenshot for this with actual backslash characters instead of Yen signs? Also change "My Obi Project" to "My Obi Projects" while we're at it.</p>
          <div class="obirdbox">
            <div class="hd">Obird suggestion</div> 
            <p>Are you wondering what a XUK file is? I suggest that you read about the <a href='#def-xuk'>XUK File format</a> in the glossary!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Opening an existing project</h4>
          <p>To open an existing project that was created previously with Obi, select <q>Open project</q> in the <q>File</q> menu, or press Ctrl+O. You will be presented with the familiar Windows file browser where you can select a <code>.xuk</code> Obi project file.</p>
          <p>Obi remembers the projects that you have previously worked on, so you can also select <q>Open recent project</q> in the <q>File</q> menu to choose from a list of the projects recently opened.</p>
          <p>Finally, Obi can be set to start automatically with the last open project; see <a href="#preferences">Setting your preferences</a> below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="project-metadata">
        <h3>Project metadata</h3>
        <p>Let's do a little bit of bookkeeping first. Because DAISY books are usually meant to be part of a larger library of books, it is important to add some <em>metadata</em>, that is information about the book, so that it can be found later on.</p>
        <p>To view or edit the metadata of your project, select <q>Metadata</q> in the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Alt+M to bring up the dialog shown below:</p>
        <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_metadata.png" alt="screenshot of the metadata dialog" /></p>
        <p class="wwwvisible"><a rel="external" href="images/manual_metadata.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img style="width:400px;height:223px;" src="images/manual_metadata.png" alt="screenshot of the metadata dialog" /></a></p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Title</dt>
          <dd>A name given to the resource. Typically, Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.</dd>
          <dt>Author</dt>
          <dd>An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource. Examples of Creator include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.</dd>
          <dt>Publisher</dt>
          <dd>An entity responsible for making the resource available. Examples of Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a Publisher should be used to indicate the entity.</dd>
          <dt>Identifier</dt>
          <dd>An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context.</dd>
          <dt>Language</dt>
          <dd>A language of the intellectual content of the resource.</dd> 
        </dl>
        <div class="obirdbox">
          <div class="hd">Obird suggestion</div>  
          <p>DAISY DTB metadata uses the Dublin Core metadata standard. You may want to learn more about <a href="http://www.daisy.org/dkn">Dublin Core at the DAISY Knowledge Network</a> and about <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core at the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a>.</p>

        <h3>Editing the table of contents</h3>

          <p class="todo">Create a sibling section (Insert section Ctrl+A) before the selection, at the same level, and at the end, if no selection. Create a subsection as last child of the selected section. Unnamed sections when created.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="renaming-section">
          <h4>Renaming a section</h4>
          <p>To modify the name of a section, select a section in the TOC view and choose <q>Rename section</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or press F2. The label for the section will be selected and you can edit it. You can also simply click on the label of the section that you want to edit until the label gets selected.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="edit-toc">
          <h4>Cut, copy, paste and delete</h4>
          <p>The familiar editing operations are available when you are working in the TOC panel (<em>i.e.</em>, when a section is selected in the TOC panel) from the <q>Edit</q> menu. All edits are <em>deep</em>, so that they affect not only the section that was selected, but all of its subsections as well.</p>
          <h5>Cut section (Ctrl+X)</h5>
          <p>The selected section is removed from the project and stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Copy section (Ctrl+C)</h5>
          <p>The selected section is stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Paste section (Ctrl+V)</h5>
          <p>When the clipboard contains a section (which was previously cut or copied), it can be pasted as a child of the selected section, along with all of its contents (subsections and recorded audio.)</p>
          <h5>Delete section (Del)</h5>
          <p>The selected section is deleted from the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="used-sections">
          <h4>Used and unused sections</h4>
          <p>While editing your project, you may want to keep some parts that are not ready or necessary for the final book but may still come handy later on. You can then mark some parts of the project as being <em>unused</em>, so that these parts will not be exported or played back. To mark a selected section as being unused, choose <q>Mark section as unused</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or press Ctrl+K. The section will be grayed-out to show its status.</p>
          <p>Similarly, you can turn a selected unused section back to <em>used</em> status again by choosing <q>Mark section as used</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+K.</p>

        <div id="creating-strips">
          <h4>Creating strips</h4>
          <p>To add a new strip to the strips view, choose <q>Insert strip</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+A. A new strip will be inserted before, and at the same level as, the selected strip, or at the top level and at the end of the project is no strip selected.</p>
          <p>The new strip has a default title that can be edited straight away. Press enter to validate the title, or escape if you do not want to change it.</p>

        <p class="todo">Audio blocks inside strips.</p>
        <div id="importing-audio">
          <h4>Importing audio</h4>
          <p>The first way to add content is to import existing audio files to your project. Obi supports only uncompressed RIFF/WAVE files, which are usually named <code>.wav</code>.</p>
          <p>To import audio, select a strip or an audio block, then choose <q>Import audio files</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu. This will bring up the Windows file chooser where you can choose one or more files to import. A new audio block will be created for every audio file that you import.</p>
          <p>If a strip was selected, the new audio blocks are added at the end of the strip. If an audio block was selected, the new audio blocks are added before the selected block. The first of the new blocks is selected so that they can easily be listened to for verification.</p>
          <div class="obirdbox">
            <div class="hd">Obird suggestion</div>
            <p>Of course you can also record your own audio directly from Obi! Have a look in the <a href="#record">Record</a> section to learn more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="split-merge">
          <p class="todo">BTW, it would be nice to have before/after screenshots for all these...</p>
          <h4>Splitting and merging audio blocks</h4>
          <p>Splitting and merging are the two most useful operations for fine audio editing as they will let you change the contents of the audio blocks in the project.</p>
          <h5>Splitting an audio block</h5>
          <p>An audio block can be split into two audio blocks by selecting a time in the audio of the block at which the separation should occur. This can be used to separate several phrases that were part of a single audio files or were not correctly separated.</p>
          <p class="todo">Basically write the description of the dialog. Also, update the screen shot when the dialog is cleaned-up...</p>
          <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_splitdialog.png" alt="the split dialog"/></p>
          <p class="wwwvisible"><a rel="external" href="images/manual_splitdialog.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img src="images/manual_splitdialog.png" alt="the split dialog"/></a></p>
          <h5>Quick-split</h5>
          <p>Quick-split works like split, except that it happens on the fly while audio is playing. When playback is in progress, select <q>Quick split audio block</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Shift+P. The currently playing block will be split at the time when the command was issued, and playback will continue.</p> 
          <h5>Merging two audio blocks</h5>
          <p>Merging two audio blocks simply merge the audio contained in two consecutive blocks into a single block, so that two phrases become just one. This is useful if a phrase was mistakenly split in two, or if a split was done at an incorrect time.</p>
          <p>To merge two audio blocks, select a block that follows another block, then choose <q>Merge with previous audio block</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+M. The selected block and the one before will be merged.</p>

          <h5>Cut audio block (Ctrl+X)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is removed from the project and stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Copy audio block (Ctrl+C)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Paste audio block (Ctrl+V)</h5>
          <p>When the clipboard contains an audio block (which was previously cut or copied), it can be pasted in at the end of the selected strip, or before the selected audio block.</p>
          <h5>Delete audio block (Del, the delete key)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is deleted from the project.</p>
          <h5>Move audio blocks (Ctrl+Shift+Left arrow key, Ctrl+Shift+Right arrow key)</h5>
          <p>Audio blocks can be quickly moved inside their strip using two move commands, for moving them forward and backward. A block cannot move to a different strip in this way; it has to be cut and then pasted.</p>

        <div id="unused-blocks">
          <h4>Used and unused audio blocks</h4>
          <p>We have seen how to mark sections as being unused, now you can do the same for audio blocks. To mark a selected audio block as being unused, choose <q>Mark audio block as unused</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+K. The block will turn gray to show its status. The block will not play when playing back the contents of the book, and will not be exported to DAISY.</p>
          <p>Similarly, you can turn a selected unused audio block back to <em>used</em> status again by choosing <q>Mark audio block as used</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+K.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="page-numbers">
          <h4>Page numbers</h4>
          <p>Page numbers can be set on any audio block. Obi manages page numbers automatically; if you add a page number mark to an audio block in your project, page numbering will be updated so that the page numbers are in the sequence of the audio blocks in the project, starting from page number 1. Future versions of Obi will give more control about page numbering.</p>
          <p>To set a page number mark on a selected audio block, choose <q>Set page number</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+G. The audio block will then show a page number.</p>
          <p>To remove a page number from a selected audio block, choose <q>Remove page number</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Del (the delete key.) The page number will disappear from the block.</p>
          <p>When your project has page numbers, you can quickly move to any block with a page number using <q>Go to page</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or pressing Alt+G. You will be presented with a list of all the pages in your book; if you select one, the selection will move to the corresponding audio block.</p>

        <div id="annotations">
          <h4>Annotations</h4>
          <p>Annotations are small text notes that are used only by Obi and are not exported to DAISY. These can be used for any purpose, for instance for marking parts that still need to be edited. Annotations are represented by annotation blocks similar to audio blocks but they cannot be selected; all operations on annotations are done by selecting the audio block that under the annotation.</p>
          <p>To edit the annotation for a selected audio block, choose <q>Edit annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press F2. You can then edit the annotation by typing directly in the text field; press return to when you are finished or escape to cancel the change.</p>
          <p>To remove an annotation on a selected audio block, choose <q>Remove annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Del (the delete key.) You can also edit the annotation and clear all the text.</p>
          <p>Because annotations are not selectable, an option is given for user of assistive technologies such as screen readers to force the focus on the annotation so that the text can be accessed. To do so, choose <q>Focus on annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Alt+Shift+A.</p>

        <div id="undo">
          <h4>Undo</h4>
          <p><em>Undo</em> is a very important command as it allows you to undo the last change that you made. When undo is enabled, the actual menu item will describe exactly what is to be undone, for instance if you delete a section, then the menu item will read <em>undo delete section</em>. Undo will restore your project to the same state that it was in just before you did this action (in this case, the section will be undeleted and restored exactly where it used to be.)</p>
          <p>To undo the last operation, choose <q>Undo</q> from the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Z.</p>
          <p>Obi will remember all the changes that you have made since you last saved (or since you created) your project, so that undoing twice will undo the last two commands, and so on. You can then undo every change and your project will be restored to its unmodified state. Remember this shortcut, it is very handy!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="redo">
          <h4>Redo</h4>
          <p>If you have undone a command, you can redo it. Obi will also remember the commands that you have undone so that you can recreate all changes that you have made. Be careful however; once you make a new change to the project, all the undone commands are discarded so you won't be able to redo them anymore (this is because your project is now in a different state that it was before you made that change, and therefore the context of undone commands may be inconsistent.)</p>
          <p>To redo the last undone operation, choose <q>Redo</q> from the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Y.</p>

        <h3>Audio playback, recording and navigation</h3>
        <p>Obi is audio playback and recording tool and has basic playback, recording and navigation features that you can use when editing your project, but also to listen to a completed or in-progress project to test what the final result will sound like to your future readers.</p>

          <h5>Play (Space)</h5>
          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-start.png" alt="play icon" class="icon"/>To start playing the audio in the project, press the play button in the transport bar or press the spacebar. If nothing is selected, playback will start from the beginning. If a section or a strip is selected, it will start from the first audio block in the selected section or strip. If an audio block is selected, it will start from this audio block.</p>
          <p>All audio blocks will be played in the order of the project until the last block has played, or until interrupted. Every time playback moves to a new block, the currently playing block is selected. Unused sections and audio blocks will be skipped.</p>
          <p>You can also play a single block, or a single strip, <em>including</em> unused blocks, by choosing <q>Play selection</q> in the <q>Transport</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+Space. You can also do the same by double-clicking a block or a strip.</p>
          <p>Most editing operations are disabled while playing audio; an exception being quick-split so that splitting long blocks can be easily done on-the-fly. To make an edit at the currently playing point in the project, please pause first (see below.)</p>
          <h5 style="clear:both">Pause (Alt+Shift+Space)</h5>
          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-pause.png" alt="pause icon" class="icon"/>Playback can be paused at anytime by pressing the pause button. The audio block that was currently playing stays selected, so that it serves as context for editing. When an edit is done while paused, playback will generally stop (see below.)</p>

          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-stop.png" alt="stop icon" class="icon"/>To stop playback, press the stop button. The selection is restored to what it was before playback started. If you stop when not playing, any selected object gets deselected.</p>

  <dl>
  <dt>Input device name</dt>
  <dd>Set the audio device to use for recording. This is the same as selecting a <em>soundcard input port</em>.</dd>
  <dt>Output device name</dt>
  <dd>Set the audio device to use for playback. This is the same as selecting a <em>soundcard output port</em>.</dd>
  <dt>Default sample rate</dt>
  <dd>Select the sample rate to use for recording. This field defaults to <code>44100</code>, and normally, you can leave it at that. Under some circumstances (such as a very large book being recorded) you may want to change this setting to <code>22050</code>.</dd>
  <dt>Default channels</dt>
  <dd>Select whether you want to record in <code>mono</code> (one channel of audio) or <code>stereo</code> (two channels of audio). Normally, DAISY DTBs are recorded in mono.</dd>

		<dl>
			<dt>New project (Ctrl+N)</dt>

			first. A file browser then lets you navigate your file system to find
			the project file to open.</dd>
			<dt>Open recent project</dt>
			<dd>Obi will remember the location of the projects that have been
			previously open so that you can quickly open them again. The projects
			are listed by their filenames. If they are in your default directory,
			then only the filename will appear; if they are somewhere else, then
			the full path will be shown.<br/>
			The "Clear list" option clears this list (be careful, as this cannot be
			undone.)<br/>
			There are no keyboard shortcuts for this item.</dd>
			<dt>Save project (Ctrl+S)</dt>
			<dd>Save all changes made to the project. Do this often as Obi does not
			save your project automatically; but be careful that after saving
			undoing previous changes becomes impossible.</dd>
			<dt>Save project as (Ctrl+Shift+S)</dt>
			<dd>Save a copy of the project with a different file name and continue
			editing this file. [FIXME: not sure about this one.]</dd>
			<dt>Discard changes (Ctrl+D)</dt>

			are lost (this cannot be undone; alternatively, you can undo all changes
			to go back to this version while still being able to redo some
			operations.)</dd>
			<dt>Close project (Ctrl+W)</dt>
			<dd>Close the project currently open. If there are unsaved changes, you
			will be asked whether to save these changes, close without saving, or
			cancel (in which case the project is not closed.)</dd>
			<dt>Export as DAISY (Ctrl+E)</dt>
			<dd>Create a DAISY ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 book from your project. The
			project must be saved before being exported. You will be asked for a
			folder location in which to save the book. This book can then be opened
			in a DAISY player such as <a href="http://amis.sf.net">AMIS</a>, but
			it <strong>cannot</strong> be opened by Obi so do not delete your Obi
			project file just yet or you won't be able to make any more changes!</dd>
			<dt>Exit (Alt+F4)</dt>
			<dd>Exit from Obi. If there is an open project with unsaved changes, you

	<h3 id="ref_menus_edit">Edit menu</h3>
	<div id="www_edit-menu">
		<p>The edit menu allows you to make, unmake and remake general changes in

		changes; you can also cut, copy, paste and delete items, and modify the
		metadata of your project.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Undo and redo
		<dl>
			<dt>Undo (Ctrl+Z)</dt>
			<dd>This is a very important command as it allows you to undo the last
			change that you made. When undo is enabled, the actual menu item will
			describe exactly what is to be undone, for instance if you delete a
			section, then the menu item will read "undo section." Undo will restore
			your project to the same state that it was in just before you did this
			action (in this case, the section will be undeleted and restored exactly
			where it used to be.)<br/>
			Obi will remember all the changes that you have made since you last
			saved (or since you created) your project, so that undoing twice will
			undo the last two commands, and so on. You can then undo every change
			and your project will be restored to its unmodified state. Remember this
			shortcut, it is very handy!
			<dt>Redo (Ctrl+Y)</dt>
			<dd>If you have undone a command, you can redo it. Obi will also remember
			the commands that you have undone so that you can recreate all changes
			that you have made. Be careful however; once you make a new change to the
			project, all the undone commands are discarded so you won't be able to
			redo them anymore (this is because your project is now in a different
			state that it was before you made that change, and therefore the context
			of undone commands may be inconsistent.)

  <dt>Obird <img src="images/obird32.png" alt="obird logo"/> </dt>
  <dd>Obird is the Obi mascot. The Obird logo consists of a picture of Obird's green head, where she is wearing a headset with a microphone. Although Obird is a Parakeet, she can narrate very well.</dd>
    
  <dt>Phrase</dt>
  <dd>
  A term used to describe a small segment of audio within a DAISY DTB.<br/> 
  A phrase is typically equivalent to a spoken sentence, or a part of a spoken sentence.<br/> 
  In Obi, a phrase is equivalent to an <a href='#gls_audioblock'>Audio Block</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="gls_section">Section</dt>
  <dd>
  A structural unit in the DTB being produced.<br/> 
  A section typically corresponds to a book <em>chapter</em>.<br/>

  <dt id="gls_strip">Strip</dt>
  <dd>A concept used in Obi to display the contents of a DTB <a href='#gls_section'>section</a>. Strips occur in the <a href='#ctrl_stripview'>Strip View</a> of the Obi main window.</dd>
  
  <dt id="def-xuk">XUK File Format</dt>
  <dd>XUK is an acronym that stands for XML for Urakawa. This is a file format used while the <a href='#gls_dtb'>DTB</a> is under production. When you save the project, by default a XUK file is created. Once the DTB is ready for publishing, the XUK file format is converted into a DTB. Note that the XUK file is only the description of the project; all audio data is contained in a separate directory.</dd>

<div id="www_keyboard-shortcuts">

<div class="infobox">
<div class="hd">How keyboard shortcut syntax works</div>
<p>In the table below, all keyboard shortcuts of Obi are described using a standard syntax. 
<br/>The key components of this syntax are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sequences of keys to be pressed are described using the comma sign</dt>
<dd>For example, <kbd>ALT,F</kbd> means: <em>First press and release the <kbd>ALT</kbd> key, then press and release the <kbd>F</kbd> key.</em></dd>
<dt>Key combinations (i.e. keys to be pressed simultaneously) are described using the plus sign</dt>
<dd>For example, <kbd>ALT+F</kbd> means: <em>Press the <kbd>ALT</kbd> and <kbd>F</kbd> key simultaneously, and then release them.</em></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<!--
Project modification invocations by default use the CTRL modkey 
(unless there is a preferred Windows standard heritage key, for example F2 = rename, DEL = delete).
View modifications (that change the GUI but not the project itself) by default use the ALT modkey
-->
<p><strong>Note:</strong> these shortcuts may change in subsequent versions of
Obi.</p>
