      <h2>What is Obi?</h2>
      <p>Obi is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> <a href="#def-daisy-niso">DAISY/NISO</a> <a href="#gls_dtb">Digital Talking Book</a> (DTB) production tool.</p>
      <p class="todo">Free to use, internationalized, accessible; audio-only; DAISY 3 export, etc.</p>
      <p>Obi is being developed as part of the Urakawa project, where tools are developed to help developers build accessible multimedia applications. Please visit <a href="http://urakawa.sf.net">the Urakawa project website</a> to find out more.</p>

	<div id="www_the-work-area">
    <div id="work-area">
      <h2>The work area</h2>
      <p>The image below shows the work area of Obi when a project is open. It consists of three parts: on the left-hand side is the <em>table of contents view</em>, or TOC view for short, where the table of contents for the project is shown; on the right-hand size is the <em>strips view</em> where the actual contents of the book are edited; and on the bottom is the <em>transport bar</em> that controls playback, recording and navigation of the audio in the project.</p>
      <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_mainwindow.png" alt="the main window, with the TOC tree view at the left, and the strip view at the right" /></p>
      <p class="wwwvisible"><a href="images/manual_mainwindow.png" title="full-size screenshot" rel="external"><img style="width:400px;height:269px;" src="images/manual_mainwindow.png" alt="the main window, with the TOC tree view at the left, and the strip view at the right" /></a></p>
      <div id="toc-view">
        <h3>The table of contents view</h3>
        <p>Using the TOC view you can navigate in the major structural elements of the project. Typically, this means that you move your current position to a certain section (or chapter if you will) of the DAISY <a href='#gls_dtb'>DTB</a> being recorded.</p>
        <p>The TOC View is a tree, which means that a section (a node in the tree) can have children. In DTB terminology, this feature is used to describe that a certain section is a sub-section (or a child) of another section.</p> 
        <p>The TOC View also allows section editing, such as adding and removing sections.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="strips-view">
        <h3>The strips view</h3>
        <p>The strips view contains <a href='#gls_strip'>strips</a>. A strip represents a section in the DTB. This also means that each strip in the strips view corresponds to one section in the TOC view.</p>
        <p>The strips view provides a more detailed view of the project. Here, you can navigate not only between the major sections of the book, but also at a much more detailed level, namely among the <a href='#gls_block'>blocks</a> that are contained within each strip. We will learn more about blocks later.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="transport-bar">
        <h3>The transport bar</h3>
        <p>The transport bar is used to playback the contents of the project and to record new audio. It has controls similar to those found on hardware or software audio players and recorders such as play, pause, stop, record, fast forward and rewind as well as more specific navigation options such as next phrase or previous section. The transport bar also displays time information and a text-version of the VU meter which can be picked up by screen readers.</p>

    <div id="authoring">	
      <h2>Authoring in Obi</h2>
      <p>Without further ado, let's see how to use Obi to author a new project or complete a project in progress.</p>
      <div id="creating-opening">
        <h3>Creating and opening projects</h3>
        <p>A project in Obi contains all of the audio data and structure information necesary to create a DAISY/NISO books. When you start Obi for the first time, no project will be open, so you will need to create a new project, or open an existing one.</p>
        <div>
          <h4>Creating a new project</h4>
          <p>To create a new project, select <q>New project</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or press Ctrl+N. A dialog will appear as shown below:</p>
          <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_newproject.png" alt="the new project dialog" /></p>
          <p class="wwwvisible"> <a rel="external" href="images/manual_newproject.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img style="width:400px;height:155px;" src="images/manual_newproject.png" alt="the new project dialog" /></a></p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Title</dt>
            <dd>The title of your project.</dd>
            <dt>Automatically create a title section with this title</dt>
            <dd>If you check this option, then the project will be created with a top-level section with this title. Otherwise, a completely empty project will be created.</dd>
            <dt>File</dt>
            <dd>The location on your hard drive where your project will be saved. You can type in a location or click on the <q>Select</q> button to bring the file browser and select a location.</dd>

          <div class="obirdbox">
            <div class="hd">Obird suggestion</div> 
            <p>Are you wondering what a XUK file is? I suggest that you read about the <a href='#def-xuk'>XUK File format</a> in the glossary!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Opening an existing project</h4>
          <p>To open an existing project that was created previously with Obi, select <q>Open project</q> in the <q>File</q> menu, or press Ctrl+O. You will be presented with the familiar Windows file browser where you can select a <code>.xuk</code> Obi project file.</p>
          <p>Obi remembers the projects that you have previously worked on, so you can also select <q>Open recent project</q> in the <q>File</q> menu to choose from a list of the projects recently opened.</p>
          <p>Finally, Obi can be set to start automatically with the last open project; see <a href="#preferences">Setting your preferences</a> below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="project-metadata">
        <h3>Project metadata</h3>
        <p>Let's do a little bit of bookkeeping first. Because DAISY books are usually meant to be part of a larger library of books, it is important to add some <em>metadata</em>, that is information about the book, so that it can be found later on.</p>
        <p>To view or edit the metadata of your project, select <q>Metadata</q> in the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Alt+M to bring up the dialog shown below:</p>
        <p class="obivisible"><img src="images/manual_metadata.png" alt="screenshot of the metadata dialog" /></p>
        <p class="wwwvisible"><a rel="external" href="images/manual_metadata.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img style="width:400px;height:223px;" src="images/manual_metadata.png" alt="screenshot of the metadata dialog" /></a></p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Title</dt>
          <dd>A name given to the resource. Typically, Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.</dd>
          <dt>Author</dt>
          <dd>An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource. Examples of Creator include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.</dd>
          <dt>Publisher</dt>
          <dd>An entity responsible for making the resource available. Examples of Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a Publisher should be used to indicate the entity.</dd>
          <dt>Identifier</dt>
          <dd>An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context.</dd>
          <dt>Language</dt>
          <dd>A language of the intellectual content of the resource.</dd> 
        </dl>
        <div class="obirdbox">
          <div class="hd">Obird suggestion</div>  
          <p>DAISY DTB metadata uses the Dublin Core metadata standard.

        <div id="renaming-section">
          <h4>Renaming a section</h4>
          <p>To modify the name of a section, select a section in the TOC view and choose <q>Rename section</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or press F2. The label for the section will be selected and you can edit it. You can also simply click on the label of the section that you want to edit until the label gets selected.</p>

          <p>The familiar editing operations are available when you are working in the TOC panel (<em>i.e.</em>, when a section is selected in the TOC panel) from the <q>Edit</q> menu. All edits are <em>deep</em>, so that they affect not only the section that was selected, but all of its subsections as well.</p>
          <h5>Cut section (Ctrl+X)</h5>
          <p>The selected section is removed from the project and stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>

          <h5>Delete section (Del)</h5>
          <p>The selected section is deleted from the project.</p>

        <div id="used-sections">
          <h4>Used and unused sections</h4>
          <p>While editing your project, you may want to keep some parts that are not ready or necessary for the final book but may still come handy later on. You can then mark some parts of the project as being <em>unused</em>, so that these parts will not be exported or played back. To mark a selected section as being unused, choose <q>Mark section as unused</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or press Ctrl+K. The section will be grayed-out to show its status.</p>
          <p>Similarly, you can turn a selected unused section back to <em>used</em> status again by choosing <q>Mark section as used</q> in the <q>TOC</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+K.</p>

          <p>To add a new strip to the strips view, choose <q>Insert strip</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+A. A new strip will be inserted before, and at the same level as, the selected strip, or at the top level and at the end of the project is no strip selected.</p>
          <p>The new strip has a default title that can be edited straight away. Press enter to validate the title, or escape if you do not want to change it.</p>

        <div id="importing-audio">
          <h4>Importing audio</h4>
          <p>The first way to add content is to import existing audio files to your project. Obi supports only uncompressed RIFF/WAVE files, which are usually named <code>.wav</code>.</p>
          <p>To import audio, select a strip or an audio block, then choose <q>Import audio files</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu. This will bring up the Windows file chooser where you can choose one or more files to import. A new audio block will be created for every audio file that you import.</p>
          <p>If a strip was selected, the new audio blocks are added at the end of the strip. If an audio block was selected, the new audio blocks are added before the selected block. The first of the new blocks is selected so that they can easily be listened to for verification.</p>
          <div class="obirdbox">

          <h4>Splitting and merging audio blocks</h4>
          <p>Splitting and merging are the two most useful operations for fine audio editing as they will let you change the contents of the audio blocks in the project.</p>
          <h5>Splitting an audio block</h5>
          <p>An audio block can be split into two audio blocks by selecting a time in the audio of the block at which the separation should occur. This can be used to separate several phrases that were part of a single audio files or were not correctly separated.</p>
          <p class="todo">Basically write the description of the dialog. Also, update the screen shot when the dialog is cleaned-up...</p>

          <p class="wwwvisible"><a rel="external" href="images/manual_splitdialog.png" title="full-size screenshot"><img src="images/manual_splitdialog.png" alt="the split dialog"/></a></p>
          <h5>Quick-split</h5>
          <p>Quick-split works like split, except that it happens on the fly while audio is playing. When playback is in progress, select <q>Quick split audio block</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Shift+P. The currently playing block will be split at the time when the command was issued, and playback will continue.</p> 
          <h5>Merging two audio blocks</h5>
          <p>Merging two audio blocks simply merge the audio contained in two consecutive blocks into a single block, so that two phrases become just one. This is useful if a phrase was mistakenly split in two, or if a split was done at an incorrect time.</p>
          <p>To merge two audio blocks, select a block that follows another block, then choose <q>Merge with previous audio block</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+M. The selected block and the one before will be merged.</p>
        </div>

      <div id="phrase-detection">
        <h4>Phrase detection</h4>
        <p class="todo">Phrase detection: detect silence between phrases of a certain length below a certain amplitude threshold. Leave leading silence before every sentence. Need a silence phrase (currently must be the first one in the whole project) of a few seconds of ambient noise. Dialog takes time to appear as level must be computed first, then splitting takes time if long asset to split.</p>

      <div id="edit-audio-blocks">
        <h4>Cut, copy, paste, delete and move</h4>
          <h5>Cut audio block (Ctrl+X)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is removed from the project and stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Copy audio block (Ctrl+C)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is stored in the clipboard to be pasted later.</p>
          <h5>Paste audio block (Ctrl+V)</h5>
          <p>When the clipboard contains an audio block (which was previously cut or copied), it can be pasted in at the end of the selected strip, or before the selected audio block.</p>
          <h5>Delete audio block (Del, the delete key)</h5>
          <p>The selected audio block is deleted from the project.</p>
          <h5>Move audio blocks (Ctrl+Shift+Left arrow key, Ctrl+Shift+Right arrow key)</h5>
          <p>Audio blocks can be quickly moved inside their strip using two move commands, for moving them forward and backward. A block cannot move to a different strip in this way; it has to be cut and then pasted.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="unused-blocks">
          <h4>Used and unused audio blocks</h4>
          <p>We have seen how to mark sections as being unused, now you can do the same for audio blocks. To mark a selected audio block as being unused, choose <q>Mark audio block as unused</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+K. The block will turn gray to show its status. The block will not play when playing back the contents of the book, and will not be exported to DAISY.</p>
          <p>Similarly, you can turn a selected unused audio block back to <em>used</em> status again by choosing <q>Mark audio block as used</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+K.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="page-numbers">
          <h4>Page numbers</h4>
          <p>Page numbers can be set on any audio block. Obi manages page numbers automatically; if you add a page number mark to an audio block in your project, page numbering will be updated so that the page numbers are in the sequence of the audio blocks in the project, starting from page number 1. Future versions of Obi will give more control about page numbering.</p>
          <p>To set a page number mark on a selected audio block, choose <q>Set page number</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+G. The audio block will then show a page number.</p>
          <p>To remove a page number from a selected audio block, choose <q>Remove page number</q> in the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Del (the delete key.) The page number will disappear from the block.</p>
          <p>When your project has page numbers, you can quickly move to any block with a page number using <q>Go to page</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or pressing Alt+G. You will be presented with a list of all the pages in your book; if you select one, the selection will move to the corresponding audio block.</p>
          <p class="todo">Add screenshot of the goto page dialog</p>
        </div>
        <div id="annotations">
          <h4>Annotations</h4>
          <p>Annotations are small text notes that are used only by Obi and are not exported to DAISY. These can be used for any purpose, for instance for marking parts that still need to be edited. Annotations are represented by annotation blocks similar to audio blocks but they cannot be selected; all operations on annotations are done by selecting the audio block that under the annotation.</p>
          <p>To edit the annotation for a selected audio block, choose <q>Edit annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press F2. You can then edit the annotation by typing directly in the text field; press return to when you are finished or escape to cancel the change.</p>
          <p>To remove an annotation on a selected audio block, choose <q>Remove annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Del (the delete key.) You can also edit the annotation and clear all the text.</p>
          <p>Because annotations are not selectable, an option is given for user of assistive technologies such as screen readers to force the focus on the annotation so that the text can be accessed. To do so, choose <q>Focus on annotation</q> from the <q>Strips</q> menu, or press Alt+Shift+A.</p>

        <p class="todo">Describe virtual edits, no changes to files made until saved.</p>
        <div id="undo">
          <h4>Undo</h4>
          <p><em>Undo</em> is a very important command as it allows you to undo the last change that you made. When undo is enabled, the actual menu item will describe exactly what is to be undone, for instance if you delete a section, then the menu item will read <em>undo delete section</em>. Undo will restore your project to the same state that it was in just before you did this action (in this case, the section will be undeleted and restored exactly where it used to be.)</p>
          <p>To undo the last operation, choose <q>Undo</q> from the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Z.</p>
          <p>Obi will remember all the changes that you have made since you last saved (or since you created) your project, so that undoing twice will undo the last two commands, and so on. You can then undo every change and your project will be restored to its unmodified state. Remember this shortcut, it is very handy!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="redo">
          <h4>Redo</h4>
          <p>If you have undone a command, you can redo it. Obi will also remember the commands that you have undone so that you can recreate all changes that you have made. Be careful however; once you make a new change to the project, all the undone commands are discarded so you won't be able to redo them anymore (this is because your project is now in a different state that it was before you made that change, and therefore the context of undone commands may be inconsistent.)</p>
          <p>To redo the last undone operation, choose <q>Redo</q> from the <q>Edit</q> menu, or press Ctrl+Y.</p>

        <h3>Audio playback, recording and navigation</h3>
        <p>Obi is audio playback and recording tool and has basic playback, recording and navigation features that you can use when editing your project, but also to listen to a completed or in-progress project to test what the final result will sound like to your future readers.</p>
        <div id="playback">
          <h4>Playback</h4>
          <h5>Play (Space)</h5>

          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-start.png" alt="play icon" class="icon"/>To start playing the audio in the project, press the play button in the transport bar or press the spacebar. If nothing is selected, playback will start from the beginning. If a section or a strip is selected, it will start from the first audio block in the selected section or strip. If an audio block is selected, it will start from this audio block.</p>
          <p>All audio blocks will be played in the order of the project until the last block has played, or until interrupted. Every time playback moves to a new block, the currently playing block is selected. Unused sections and audio blocks will be skipped.</p>
          <p>You can also play a single block, or a single strip, <em>including</em> unused blocks, by choosing <q>Play selection</q> in the <q>Transport</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+Space. You can also do the same by double-clicking a block or a strip.</p>
          <p>Most editing operations are disabled while playing audio; an exception being quick-split so that splitting long blocks can be easily done on-the-fly. To make an edit at the currently playing point in the project, please pause first (see below.)</p>
          <h5 style="clear:both">Pause (Alt+Shift+Space)</h5>
          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-pause.png" alt="pause icon" class="icon"/>Playback can be paused at anytime by pressing the pause button. The audio block that was currently playing stays selected, so that it serves as context for editing. When an edit is done while paused, playback will generally stop (see below.)</p>
          <h5 style="clear:both">Stop (Esc, the escape key)</h5>
          <p><img src="images/icons/media-playback-stop.png" alt="stop icon" class="icon"/>To stop playback, press the stop button. The selection is restored to what it was before playback started. If you stop when not playing, any selected object gets deselected.</p>

          <p><img src="images/icons/media-record.png" alt="record icon" class="icon"/>New audio can be recorded by Obi. To record new audio, first select an audio block <em>before</em> which to record (new audio blocks will be created before the selected block), or a strip at the end of which to record (new audio blocks will be created at the end of the selected strip.) If no selection is made before recording, a new section will be created automatically.</p>
          <p>Once the selection is made, press the record button, or Ctrl+R. This will bring up the record dialog shown below:</p>

        <h4>Saving</h4>
        <p>Remember to save your project often! All unsaved changes will be lost if you quit Obi withouth saving (or, unfortunately, if Obi crashes.) To save your project, choose <q>Save project</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or press Ctrl+S. When your project is saved, all changes to the audio files are committed to disk, so it is not possible to undo your changes anymore.</p>
        <p>You can also save your project to a different name or a different location, by choosing <q>Save project as</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+S. You will have to choose a location for your new file.</p>
        <p>You may also want to cancel all of the changes that you made since you last saved. This can be done quickly by choosing <q>Discard changes</q> from the <q>File</q> menu or pressing Ctrl+D. Be careful as this cannot be undoe.</p>

      <div id="exporting">
        <h4>Exporting</h4>
        <p>When your project is ready to be distributed as a DAISY book, or you want to test it in a DAISY player, you can export it to a DAISY book by choosing <q>Export as DAISY</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+E. You will have to choose a directory in which to export your book. Note that changes to audio files need to be saved before export can take place, so if you don't want to save your project just yet, you shouldn't export it right now.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="closing">
        <h4>Closing and exitting</h4>
        <p>Obi can work with a single project open at once at the moment. If you want to work on a different project, you need to close the current project, by choosing <q>Close project</q> in the <q>File</q> menu, or pressing Ctrl+W. If changes were made, you will be asked if you want to save them before closing. Note that if you want to open a different project, you can do so directly without having to close the current project first.</p>
        <p>Lastly, when you are done with Obi, you can qui by choose <q>Exit</q> from the <q>File</q> menu, or pressing Alt+F4. Once again, you will be given the change to save changes to the current project if there were any.</p>
