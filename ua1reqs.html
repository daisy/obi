      First draft, Monday 20 February 2006</address>

    <p>This document summarizes the requirements for the first iteration
    of the Urakawa Application (UA.) This application will be built on top of
    the Urakawa Toolkit (UT) and will be used to demonstrate and test some of
    its features.

    </ol>

    <h3 id="feat1">1.1 Import and Export</h3>
    <p>The UA should support import and export of both Daisy 2.02 and Z books.
    Depending on what the UT finally implements, we may have to do our own
    conversion, or rely on external tools such as <a
      href="http://daisymfc.sourceforge.net/pipeline.html">DMFC</a>.
    Back-conversion (from Z to 2.02) may also be restricted.</p>
    <p class="in">One advantage of supporting both formats is that the
    users can then upgrade their books from one version of Daisy to the
    next. New features, such as skippable items or resources, can then be
    added to an &#x201c;old&#x201d; book.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat2">1.2 Addition and Recording of Resources</h3>
    <p>The Z spec introduces <a href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html#Resource">resources</a>. When creating new books (see below) or
    editing/upgrading existing books, the producer can add resources such as
    chapter titles, custom audio for page numbers, etc.</p>
    <p class="in">In order to add these resources, the UA will need to provide
    its own sound recording and editing facility. The UA sound editor should
    have a GUI to allow visualization of the waveforms and at least
    feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>support for DAISY audio formats (PCM, ADPCM2, MPEG-1/2 Layer 2/3,
      and MPEG-4 AAC) both for import and export;</li>
      <li>live recording;</li>
      <li>basic editing (cut, copy, paste, delete...);</li>
      <li>basic sound processing (change volume, speed and pitch, insert
      silence, noise removal, equalization...);</li>
      <li>sentence detection (?), or at least a concept of
      &#x201c;phrases&#x201d;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat3">1.3 Import of DTBook file</h3>
    <p>The UA will <em>not</em> feature a markup editor so any DTBook file
    is provided externally, although minimal editing will be possible (see
    below.) Starting from the DTBook file we can generate a skeleton for the
    book. The NCX is automatically extracted from the DTBook file, and the
    phrases can be identified by the original markup or a sentence
    detector.</p>
    <p class="in">Providing audio can then be done automatically through TTS,
    with automatic synchronization of the text and the audio, or through live
    recording, as for resources. The exact specification of this feature
    (live audio recording by a narrator) remains to be determined.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat4">1.4 Skippable and Escapable Structures</h3>
    <p><a
      href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html#Escape">Escapable
      structures</a> are tied to resources as each structure marked as
    escapable must have a corresponding resource. <a
      href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html#Skip">Skippable
      structures</a> management entails that the UA provides a UI layer to
    the author to manage custom tests and attributes. Some presets should be
    provided, with the ability for the author to customize further the
    behavior of their books.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat5">1.5 Navigation Features</h3>
    <p>The minimal support for navigation features is the management of the
    main <a
      href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html#NCX">navigation
      map</a>, through basic editing such as cut, copy, paste, delete,
    duplicate, show/hide (hiding an item would hide it, and remove it when
    exporting it, but would still be kept in the internal representation
    and could be shown again at any time.)</p>
    <p class="in">If it is supported by the UT, exporting a whole map or
    sections of a map, as well as importing navigation items into an existing
    map, would be a welcome addition.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat6">1.6 Text Editing</h3>
    <p>As the text markup happens outside of the UA, the first objective with
    regards to text editing is to make sure that external modifications of the
    textual documents can be made easily and that the text can be re-imported
    with minimal loss of information. Additionally, editing the TOC of a book
    is an easy way to modify the structure of a document by moving or deleting
    sections as a whole.</p>
    <p class="in">We should try to make it possible to make small changes to
    the text, such as correcting a typo or deleting a sentence possible, while
    maintaining the validity of the underlying DTBook document. This may open
    a can of worm as we do not want to provide full support for markup so this
    feature will require some care in its exact specification.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat7">1.7 International Language Support</h3>
    <p>Support for language other than English needs to be built-in from day
    one. This includes handling of text in any language supported by Unicode,
    multilingual books, bidirectional text, language-dependent sentence
    detection, etc.</p>
    <p class="in">We are currently working on a localization framework for
    AMIS, and we plan to use this framework for the localization of the UA.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <h3 id="feat8">1.8 Full Accessibility</h3>
    <p>An overreaching goal to keep in mind is that the UA should be fully
    usable by persons with disability without any need for external help or
    supervsion. In the case of blind users, or users with low visibility, this
    means that the UA should work with screen readers or be self-voicing. The
    first choice is probably the best, as the cost of producing voice prompts
    for an application is very high and makes further developments extremely
    complicated. The downside being of course that speakers of languages for
    which there is no readily available screen reader or speech synthesizer
    are at a disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="back"><a href="#list">[feature list]</a></p>

    <p class="back"><a href="#toc">[TOC]</a></p>

    <h2 id="ui">2 User Interface Principles and Usability</h2>
    <p>DAISY is aimed at a varied audiences, including people with visual or
    cognitive disabilities. Therefore we should work towards making a tool to
    not only read but also create DAISY books available to these audiences.
    The DAISY For All project also trains users all over the world to create
    DAISY books and an easier production tool would make the trainings much
    more efficient. Therefore, ease of use and accessibility of the interface
    should be our main concern, to the possible detriment of more powerful
    capabilities.</p>
    <p class="in">Key points (to be completed): multiple, but simple views;
    use of HTML for accessible, internationalizable and customizable interface
    (verbose, with only images, just text, etc.) rather than relying on
    common widgets; extensibility through scripting (see below.)</p>

    <p class="back"><a href="#toc">[TOC]</a></p>

    <h2 id="impl">3 Implementation and Technical Considerations</h2>
    <p>The implementation will be in two main phases. The first phase is the
    prototyping phase and ends March, 31st. By this time it is expected that
    the high-level design of the application is set and a mockup is built.
    The mockup can be used to demonstrate a typical usage scenario of the
    application from start to finish of a project. The first version of the
    actual application will then be implemented during the second phase, from
    April to August of 2006.</p>
    <p class="in">The language of choice for the application prototype is
    C# using Windows Forms. It is expected that application itself will be
    mostly written in C#, with possible inclusion of C++ (at the very least
    for interfacing with the toolkit.)</p>
    <p class="in">An additional implementation point is that we <em>could</em>
    include scripting capabilities in the application, using a lightweight
    scripting language such as <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. This would allow a quick
    implementation of some features, and the possibility of power users to
    add their own features.</p>
