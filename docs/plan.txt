# Plan for Obi - 2008

`$Id$`

<div id="toc">Table of contents</div>

Obi is a DAISY/NISO NCX-Only Digital Talking Book production tool, based on the
Urakawa SDK.

Obi is designed to be a powerful yet user-friendly audio-centric authoring
environment, which is easy to learn and use, fully accessible and
internationalized.

Late 2007,  the first alpha of Obi 1.0 was released. During Q1 and Q2 2008, Obi
will undergo extensive testing, internal at first, then public. This will lead
to the eventual late Q2/early Q3 release of version 1.0, at which point the Obi
team will switch to ``maintenance mode,'' where it will concentrate on fixing
bugs reported by users, improve usability and accessibility, and add select
features based on input from the user community.


## Timeline

### Internal testing (Q1)

Obi has reached a so-called ``alpha'' status in early 2008. Under the supervision of Avneesh Singh, a testing team has been built at NAB in New Delhi, India, and during March and April, Obi will undergo extensive structured testing.

The goal of this testing period is to make sure that Obi can be used to author
NCX-only audio books meeting the needs of an actual producing organization,
as well as test its actual accessibility.

### Public/beta testing (Q2)

After successful completion of internal testing at NAB, a beta version of Obi
will be released early Q2 and be widely distributed. The beta version will
be almost feature-complete; feedback from the users is expected to help track
remaining bugs and updates will be released to distribute improvements. The
beta version is expected to feature:

* a user-friendly, accessible installer;
* text documentation (see below);
* full accessibility across all functionality, meaning that at least:
  * all controls should be adequately understood by screen-readers;
  * all functionality, including waveform editing, can be controlled by the
    keyboard;
* valid ANSI/NISO Z39.86 export, which can be played back in AMIS;
* projects created with Obi 1.0 can be opened with future versions;
* high-contrast version of the interface is available when changing the system
  setting;
* robust audio engine (recording and playback);
* integrated QA playback.

### Release and maintenance (Q3/Q4)

As Obi 1.0 is released in late Q2/early Q3, the current Obi Development Team
will be replaced by the Obi Maintenance and Support Team, lead by Avneesh Singh.

Maintenance of Obi will consist of fixing bugs found after the release of
version 1.0; translating Obi to other languages (see below); and adding
features from the list below. Although feedback from users will be considered,
especially for the sake of improving usability, addition of new features will
initially be constrained by the following list as well as the progress of Tobi
(_i.e._, a complex new feature shouldn't be added if it would be best handled
by Tobi.)

## Improvements and new features

This lists the main points where we foresee improvements in the future. This
list does not go into precise details of some of the features (for instance,
exact behavior of nested blocks is not defined here) and there is still room
for new additions based on public reaction to the first release of Obi and its
use by individuals and organizations.

### Usability and accessibility

* Scalable interface: the overall size of text and controls can be embiggened.

* Color schemes: new color schemes can be chosen by the user, indepently from
  setting high contrast in the system.

* Editing of multiple projects within a single Obi session, and better
  clipboard support both within Obi (copying and pasting between different
  projects) and between Obi and the system.

* Multiple selection: currently only one item can be selected at once. Having
  multiple selection will help improve productivity.

### Import and export

* Better Z39.86 support:
  * finer metadata management (additional attributes for metadata elements);
  * further NCX support (audio labels for title and author; special pages);
  * nested blocks will allow for escapable items and footnotes (also audio
    tables).

* Export to DAISY 2.02, either directly from Obi or (more likely) by
  downgrading Z output to 2.02 with the DAISY Pipeline.

* Import of DAISY 2.02 and Z39.86 content through the Pipeline.

* Seamless integration of the DAISY Pipeline: can be called directly from a
  menu. This will allow to use the DTB validation and DTB distribution
  functionality suites within the Pipeline.


### Documentation and examples

* A user manual in XHTML format is currently being edited and will be
  completed for the beta release. It will be updated with each new release
  to reflect changes in functionality.

* An abridged, NCX-only DAISY book will be produced with Obi itself and made
  available both as a Z book (readable with AMIS for instance), and as an
  Obi project.

* Testing periods will allow to create sample content that will be made
  available, either as part of Obi's normal distribution or through the Web.
    * Short project demonstrating Obi's basics;
    * Short project demonstrating Obi's features;
    * Full-scale project (e.g. public domain book) demonstrating Obi's
      capabilities.

### Localization

* Availability of the new DAISY Lion localization framework will allow
  translation of Obi in different languages. It is expected that the standard
  Obi distribution will include all existing translations, so the availability
  of new localizations will result in new releases.

* Possible localizations, both on-site and remotely:
  * Hindi (with NAB);
  * Japanese (with ATDO);
  * Chinese (to coincide with WWW2008 in Beijing);
  * European languages, done remotely by volunteers.

* Right-to-left language (_e.g._, Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu...) support can be
  implemented when adequate technical support has been identified; localization
  proper can then follow using the DAISY Lion.
