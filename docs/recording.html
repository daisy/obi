    <h2 id="id18405">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Obi has no recording modes as recording behavior is dependant on context. This
is intended to be less surprising and error-prone for the user. Moreover, there
is user setting disallowing any overwriting providing even more safety for
non-expert users.</p>
    <h2 id="id18416">Selection modes</h2>
    <p>We assume that a project is currently open in Obi. When no project is open,
the transport bar and hence the recorder are disabled. Currently Obi allows the
selection of only one item at a time. Therefore, the six possible selection
contexts are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Nothing is selected.</li>
      <li>A section node is selected in the TOC view.</li>
      <li>A strip is selected in the strips view. </li>
      <li>An audio block is selected in the strips view.</li>
      <li>The playback cursor is set inside an audio block. Nothing is selected but
there exists a position within the audio.</li>
      <li>A range of the waveform displayed in a block is selected. The block itself
is not selected; only a chunk of audio is.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="id18457">Dummy section, strip and block</h3>
    <p>When the focus is in the TOC view, there is always a <em>dummy selection</em> as the
first child of the selected section, or before the first section if no section
is selected. This allows to always have a selected section <em>after</em> which to
add, paste, or in this case record. See scenarios below for examples of use.</p>
    <p class="indent">When the focus is in the Strips view, there is likewise a <em>dummy strip</em> as the
first strip in the view that allows to add new strips <em>before</em> the actual first
strip. Lastly, when a strip is selected, there is a <em>dummy block</em> as the first
block of the selected strip.</p>
    <h2 id="id18494">Recording behaviors (inserting, overwriting)</h2>
    <p>This is what happens when the user hits "record" in any of the selection
context.</p>
    <h3 id="id18503">1. Nothing is selected.</h3>
    <p>A new, unnamed strip is created at the end of the project and recording starts
immediately in this strip. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> recording can occur before any
structure has been set and the new strip acts as an audio scratchpad. Audio
contents will later be edited bu cutting and pasting when the structure is
created.</p>
    <h3 id="id18518">2. A section node is selected in the TOC view.</h3>
    <p>Recording starts at the end of the strip corresponding to that section, so this
is effectively equivalent to recording after the the last block. <strong>Usage
scenario:</strong> phrases can be recording into existing sections through the TOC
view. If there is already content, it is not affected; editing in the strip
allows to reorder the audio contents.</p>
    <h3 id="id18535">3. A strip is selected in the strips view.</h3>
    <p>Like in case #2, recording starts after the last block of the selected strip.
<strong>Usage scenario:</strong> sections can be created in the strips view as well and
recording can start straight away.</p>
    <h3 id="id18549">4. An audio block is selected in the strips view.</h3>
    <h4 id="id18553">4.1. The selected block is a regular audio block</h4>
    <p>Recording starts in the strip where the block is selected. New phrases are
created <em>after</em> the selected block and before the blocks that may follow.
<strong>Usage scenario:</strong> new audio is recorded between the selected block and the
block that follows, or at the end of the strip if this is the last bock of the
strip.</p>
    <h4 id="id18572">4.2. The selected block is the dummy block</h4>
    <p>Equivalent to 4.1. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> new audio can be recorded at the
beginning of the strip, regardless of its contents.</p>
    <h4 id="id18585">4.3. The selected block is empty</h4>
    <p>In this case, audio is recorded <em>inside</em> the selected block, and following
phrases are added after this block, and before the blocks that may follow.
<strong>Usage scenario:</strong> after importing a project from XHTML, or after reading a
project that had missing audio, the missing audio can be quickly replaced by
recording into the empty blocks. A likely case is recording page numbers for
imported projects.</p>
    <h4 id="id18606">Composite blocks</h4>
    <p>A composite block (not implemented yet; <em>e.g.</em> the heading for a section with
several phrases or a table row) is treated like a block. When the composite
block itself is selected, recording takes place after the block; when a block
inside the composite block is selected then the new blocks are added after
the selected block inside the composite block.</p>
    <h3 id="id18622">5. The playback cursor is set inside an audio block.</h3>
    <p>The recorded audio is recorded at the insertion point directly into the block,
without overwriting any data or creating new blocks. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> if the
original block is <code>[AZ]</code> and the new audio is <code>U</code>, then the result of the
recording is the single block <code>[AUZ]</code>.</p>
    <p class="indent">If the user records several phrases, then the original block is split right
after the end of the first recorded phrase and the following phrases are
inserted in between the results of the split. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> if the
original block is <code>[AZ]</code> and the user records the phrases <code>U</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>W</code>, ...
then the result is <code>[AU] [V] [W] ... [Z]</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="id18678">6. A range of the waveform displayed in a block is selected.</h3>
    <p>The selected chunk of audio is deleted, then the new audio is recorded in its
place in the same block. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> this allows the easy correction
of mistakes inside a phrase. If the original block is <code>[ASZ]</code> with <code>S</code> being
the selected chunk and the user records the phrase <code>U</code>, the result is <code>[AUZ]</code>.</p>
    <p class="indent">If the user records several phrases, then the original block is split right
after the end of the first recorded phrase and the following phrases are
inserted in between the results of the split. <strong>Usage scenario:</strong> If the
original block is <code>[ASZ]</code> with <code>S</code> being the selected chunk and the user
records the phrases <code>U</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>W</code>, ... the result is the blocks <code>[AU] [V] [W]
... [Z]</code>.</p>
    <p class="indent">Another usage for this mode is to replace all of the audio of a block by
selecting all of the waveform, then recording. (Note that also normal edit
operations such as delete and cut work as expected with the waveform selection
so deleting all the audio can also be achieved in this way.)</p>
    <h2 id="id18748">Safety setting</h2>
    <p>There is a user setting that can be turned on or off (and is stored in the user
preferences for future sessions) at any time to allow or disallow all possible
overwrites as a safety mechanism. When this setting is on, selection context
number 6 (the only one where data is overwritten) is treated like selection
context number 5 with the cursor position being at the end of the selection. <br/>
(Note: this is what was referred to as mutable/unmutable modes in the second
draft, but has been moved to a user preferrence.)</p>
    <h2 id="id18766">Creating phrases, pages and sections on the fly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating phrases</li>
      <li>Creating page: does this mean that the block selected gets a page number
(automatically assigned) or that the next block to be recorded will get a
page number?</li>
      <li>Creating sections: the section is split after the last block, and a new
section is introduced.</li>
      <li>Creating composite blocks?</li>
    </ul>
