# Navigation

* Tab is linear: move from node to node in a depth-first way
* Arrows:
  * up: moves up the tree inside contents, then to previous section.
  * down: moves to next section.
  * right: moves to next phrase, or first phrase of container. Don't go
    outside of strips, but go outside of containers.
  * left: moves to previous phrase, or last phrase of container/section.


# Behavior (blocks)

* Dummy node in the TOC
* Cursor between blocks
  * Add to node selection: a node is always selected; may have cursor.
* Empty:
  * Record: transform into audio block (like dummy node)
  * Import audio: transform into audio block (like dummy node)
  * Paste a block:
