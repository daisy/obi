# Navigation

* Tab is linear: move from node to node in a depth-first way
* Arrows:
  * up: moves up the tree inside contents, then to previous section.
  * down: moves to next section.
  * right: moves to next phrase, or first phrase of container. Don't go
    outside of strips, but go outside of containers.
  * left: moves to previous phrase, or last phrase of container/section.
  * Ctrl+Arrow moves cursor instead of selection
* Playback moves cursor, not selection.


# Behavior (blocks)
