REMAINING ITEMS AND WORK DISTRIBUTION FOR ITERATION ONE
OVERARCHING TIMELINE AND VERSION STRATEGY NOW UNTIL VERSION 1.0



** agenda items for the week **
1. Main purpose: to get the audio backend working
2. Extended responsibilites and additional worktasks for Avneesh and Suman
3. A DAISY DTB introduction session
4. API: if 2005 works for Avneesh and Suman, we could move the audio backend to 2005
5. API: Exception typing


** DAY ONE (Monday)**
Short walkthrough among participants
Avneesh: 
	all that remains in audio backend is a bit of adjustments to the API.
Julien: 
	Main integration work to do is:
	Content strips with phrases; synchronizing the phrases, either during recording or after recording
    	Also, phrases are synchronized with section headings or phrases or nothing
	
	When it comes to the integration, its tricky to divide the above work.

	Suggested tasks for Avneesh and Suman:	  	
  	
  	Splitting and merging assets
  	  A preview function, primarly for splitting:
  	    select an asset to split: two modes
  	      play, pause at split point, select split  
  	      we need a preview so that we can listen before committing the change
  	      need a dialog for splitting where you listen to the phrase, go forward backward fast and slow
  	      function play from splitting point  	      
  	      The possibility to invoke split dialog either when a phrase selected or when you are playing
  	      If the player has no current position, time is at zero in the phrase, so splitting not allowed  	        	        	      
  	  Merging can probably be done without a dialog
  	
  	feature set SPLITTING DIALOG  
  	  This is a separate dialog 
  	  We dont implement the "play, pause at split point, split" feature at this time.
  	  It should look as much as possible as the play dialog; should do everything the play dialog does, and more.
  	  fast forward
  	  slow forward
  	  fast rewind
  	  fast rewind
  	  box that shows current position is editable, to allow jumping
  	  when you pause, the point of pause is the split point.
  	  preview button: starts plaaing from cutting point, plays only the first couple of seconds. 
  	  Preview is the only method of listening that doesnt change the split position
  	  stop button; closes without splitting (equal to cancel) 
  	  split button; will split and close dialog, unless we are the beginning or at the end
  	  When we close dialog with split button it doesnt split, it only generates an event: SplitRequestEvent
  	  
  	  The project catches the event and executes the split, rename etc.
  	  At this point, the strip asset is in annotation edit mode, but a new unique name is already given.
  	  
  	  Splitting dialog API: 
  	    invoked with a CoreNode and an initial time position
  	    private time var which is splitt pos
  	    accessor to get this position (when dialog is closed, this position is queried)
  	    split button should be accept button, and stop should be cancel button.
  	  
  	  
  	Front end for phrase detection:
  	  Have one audio asset, want to separate that into phrases. 
  	  For the user we want it to be a one button thing; 
  	  and a dialog where you could change threshold values, but should have sensible defaults.

	VUMeter integration in front end
	  Useful to have not only when recording but also when playing.
  	
  	Modal dialog for playing and recording  	
  	  When AudioPlayer or AudioRecorder is invoked, a modal dialog is opened:
  	    feature set PLAYER DIALOG
  	      instantiated with a node, which can rootnode, sectionnode or phrase node
  	      play should start
  	      phrase node implemented first  	      
  	      Should show:
  	      	- which asset is playing (show the name; the phrases nodes annotation channels textmedia object)
  	      	- current time position, being updated at an interval of 1/10th 
  	      	- buttons: 
  	      	     In first simple version  	      	       
  	      	       pause/play
  	      	       stop (closes the dialog) 	       
  	      	     In possible second more advanced version
			stop (stop playback, rewind to beginning)
			close (closes the dialog)
			pause (same button as play button) stop playback at position)
  	      		play (same button as pause button)
  	      		fastforward
  	      		rewind
  	      		playback speed slider  	      		  	      		
  	      		time remaining
  	    feature set RECORDER DIALOG
  	      	ability to adjust input volume slider
  	      	time counter which is reset for every new asset
  	      buttons: 
  	      	record and pause (same button with toggle function)  	      	
  	      	stop
  	      	phrase marker
  	      	  
  	      We also need to have a place to set:
  	       number of channels, samplerate
  	       We choose a separate tab in the preferences dialog
  	       so the preferences dialog should now have a project tab and an recording tab
  	       we also need menu items that opens a specified tab directly, in
  	       other words menu: "project preferences", and menu: "audio preferences"
  	      
  	      Pause button, stop recording, finish asset, keeps dialog open
  	      Stop button: stop recording, finish asset, close dialog
  	      Phrase button: keeps recording but creates a new asset
  	       
  	      At "Record" in main view:
  	      Open dialog, already set to listening, but not recording
  	      Initialized with user settings which are passed to dialog as argument
  	      Dialog maintains a list of created assets; and exposes these
  	      
  	      Events: 
  	        - CreatedAsset
  	        - FinishedAsset
  	      
  	      Working order:  	      
  	      Julien changes the preferences object and modifies the dialog
  	      Suman writes the code for the new preferences dialog
  	        channels (mono,stereo) radio button
  	        sample rate (11025, 22050, 44100, 48000) where 44100 is the default
  	      	We fix the bit depth to 16 bits for  now so no setting needed for that.  
  	      	We still create a preference however, in order to be able to fix it later; but
  	      	at the moment no GUI item for changing it.
  	      While Suman does preferences, Julien creates basic record dialog API, then Suman
  	      can work on that.
  	      	  	      	  
  	Input/Output device selection in preferences
  	  Problem: how to find a name of devices to display to the user
  	  Problem: how to persist a device selection: via strings?
  	  change to a GetDeviceInformation object
  	  Settings class: this is what is saved between sessions
  	    lastOutputDevice and lastInputDevice
  	  Suman: in Dialogs.Preferences 
  	   -add two comboboxes: input device and output device
  	   -add two fields in preferences
  	   -initialize
  	   -save
  	   when dialog is created, ask audioplayer about list
  	   when user changes in dialogs, update audioplayer  	   
  	   ObiForm.InitializeSettings; should select preference instead
  	     	    	  
  	Start to think about the QA Player  
  	  Bare minimum is: You have one asset; you can play it and stop it.
  	  Play the section heading assets in the tree
  	  	Select a node a play only the audio phrase that is associated with a heading
  	  Ideal is:
  	    play the whole book
  	    play a strip
  	    navigate

   Today;
      Suman starts working on the record dialog
      
** DAY THREE (Wednesday)**      
  Decision to move phrase detection forward in time.
  We may push it to iteration two, or as an assignment during the next two weeks.
  Julien: updates to the toolkit have been made that break Obi: dont recompile.
    
  Summary of where we are:
  Yesterday; 
    Avneesh: player more or less complete
    Split dialog to SVN; basic structure    
    Suman: completed preferences dialog
    Recorder basic functionality done
    
  Today:  
    Avneesh: continue working on the split dialog
    Suman: continue on the recorder    
    Markus: keyboard navigation; how to implement tabbing on custom control
    Julien: 	management of audio blocks inside audio strip
    		redo events for recorder
    
** DAY FOUR (Thursday) **

 Yesterday;
   play dialog problems finished
   strip view keyboard navigation starting to work
   
 Today
   Markus: 
   	context menu for text label in strips
   	taborder reflow
   	move between tree and strip, maintaning section position
   Avneesh: Split Dialog

   Suman: recording   
   

** DAY FIVE **   
   SVN:
     Sandbox renamed to misc, and the old project goes in there

   Yesterday,
     Markus:
       taborder reflow
       context menus
     Avneesh:
       split additions being commited right now
       import asset and import clip function in asset manager
       Player: new overload, play from point
     Suman:
       finished implementing basic recording, submitted this morning
       some changes to the audio recorder
     Julien:
       Mostly moving the backend into the application
       Original audiobackend now splitinto two namespaces: assets and audio  
               
   Today,
      Directly after lunch, write remaining actions list
      Julien: audio device change: device object
        problem: no way to tell current name of device
            also an abstract object allows us to change implementation
        default device should not be first (primary capture driver)   
      Julien: the reopen XUK problem   
      Suman and Julien look at state change problem in recorder
      Suman: writes audio device class.
      Suman: phrase button: 
        Initial plan was: 
        	when pressed closes the asset and creates a new one immediately
        But instead:
        	Collect a list in milliseconds in recorder for each phrase
        	Send a new event AssetCreated, although it actually isnt at the point of pressing "new phrase"
        	Then, use AudioMediaAsset.getChunk()
      Avneesh:
        comment the audio code
      Markus:
        move between tree and strip, maintaning section position
        abstract block
        unbold the label when edited
          
        
   
   
iteration 2-n feature local collection area
     (more in "REMAINING ITEMS" below)
     remember the size of the main window between sessions
     implement phrase detection; add a one or several ways to provide sensible parameters to the already existing detection routine     
     exception typing, exception localization
     graceful handling of invalid phrases/blocks (for iter 1, invalid nodes on reading XUK (missing physical resource for example) are skipped
       StatusProperty used, unused, synchronized, invalid
     phrase detection  
     control strip (play, pause rec etc)
     integration/removal of the play, rec, split dialogs(?)
     remove tabbing in stripview and use arrowkeys ruled by .Node
