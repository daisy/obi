# Please follow this entry format. One line per field. Run the tasks.pl
# script on this file to generate HTML output; watch out for "skipped"
# messages.

# "What" should be a short description of the task.
# "When" should tell when the task is expected to be completed, and can also
# include an evaluation of the time it should take (or a time span in which
# it should be completed.)
# "Who" is who.
# "Done" can be: NO (default), NOTYET, YES, LATER
# "And" can be ommitted, but should contain notes, etc.

What? Switch back to current toolkit.
When? September
Who? Julien
Done? NOTYET
And? We are now using the tagged version and are waiting for Ole's OK to move back to the trunk version of the toolkit.

What? Audio backend cleanup.
When? September
Who? Avneesh
Done? YES
And? Julien has to better document the management of the audio player, recorder and VU meter instances.

What? Playback behavior.
When? September
Who? Avneesh
And? Julien should review the playback document to make sure that it's in sync with the forthcoming changes.

What? Mockup manual.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? Have a mockup of the user manual (at least a skeleton) so that features to be implemented are documented. This is used for reference and testing.
Done? NOTYET

What? New project panel design and implementation.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? Add a metadata view instead of the dialog, and use the transport bar instead of the record dialog. Make everything undoable. This breaks the old Obi so a tag is introduced (Obi-0.9) Make the TOC view scalable as well.
Done? NOTYET

What? Scalable editable labels.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? Editable labels that automatically scale to accomodate larger font sizes. Tese labels are used in most other controls so that they can scale along with the label.
Done? YES

What? New strips.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? No margin between strips, use the entire width of the strips view. Make the strips scalable.
Done? NOTYET

What? New block design.
When? September
Who? Julien
Done? YES
And? Pretty much done; see the mockup documentation.

What? New block design implementation.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? Break this down further.
# And? Remove annotation blocks (annotations are displayed in the block); show waveform in blocks; implement different kinds of blocks and properties, and separate content and container blocks. The documentation mockup has details.

What? Waveform display.
When? September
Who? Julien
And? Audio blocks display the waveform of their content. 

What? Obi 0.10.0
When? October 10th
Who? Julien
And? Obi reaches version 0.10.0 where Obi is stable enough to implement the October tasks.

What? Mark custom blocks on the fly.
When? October
Who? Avneesh
And? Main block classes (phrases, pages, sections) have their button and shortcut, but all other classes can be added through an extra custom button.

What? Import structure
When? October
Who? Marisa
Done? NOTYET
And? The HTML file can contain page blocks and heading blocks. When the project is created within Obi, empty blocks are created as well.

What? Record into empty blocks
When? October
Who? Julien
And? When an empty block is selected for recording, record in that block instead of creating a new one. When the user presses "next phrase/page/etc.", record in the next block if it is empty and matches the block kind, or create a new block of that kind.

What? Import audio into empty blocks
When? October
Who? Julien
And? When an empty block is selected, do not create a new block to import audio in. If importing several files, create new blocks for the other files.

What? Skippable items.
When? November
Who? Julien

What? Escapable items.
When? November
Who? Julien

What? Organize coding workshop.
When? September
Who? Julien, Dipendra
Done? NOTYET
And? Julien proposed last week of November.

What? Waveform editing.
When? October
Who? Julien, Avneesh
And? Julien to take care of mouse operation, Avneesh to help with keyboard and accessibility.

What? Page numbering.
When? October
Who? Julien
And? Manual numbering, renumbering on demand, support for front, main and special pages.

What? Search text.
When? October
Who? Marisa
And? Search text in section titles, annotations, metadata, custom classes, page numbers. Use a VI model with / which brings up a popup dialog, and selects the current search result in the view that has focus (e.g. text found in a section title selects the TOC node in the TOC view, or the strip otherwise.)

What? Split and merge sections.
When? October
Who? Julien
And? This is necessary for punch-in recording.

What? Recording modes
When? October
Who? Avneesh
And? Add a new recording mode to allow punch-in in addition to append.  Punch-in should overwrite what is selected; when new blocks or sections are added, they are right after the replaced selection.

What? VU meter graphical improvements.
When? October
Who? Avneesh

What? Configurable colors and default color schemes.
When? November
Who? Julien and Avneesh

What? Configurable font sizes.
When? November
Who? Julien and Avneesh

What? Multiple selection.
When? November
Who? Julien and Marisa
And? At first, just do batch operations; disable operations which are not trivial in the case of multiple selections. Use the command manager to show a single operation.

What? Phrase detection.
When? November
Who? Avneesh and Julien

What? User preferences and profile.
When? November
Who? Julien

What? Project cleanup
When? November
Who? Marisa
And? Unreferenced audio data is deleted from the asset manager (this part is handled by the toolkit), then unused nodes and their audio data are deleted from the tree. This clears the undo stack as well and modifies the project.

What? Publish
When? November
Who? Marisa
And? A complete copy of the tree along with all of its audio data is made. Cleanup (toolkit) and pruning (Obi) of the copy is performed. The audio assets are consolidated (one audio file per section; file names in the same order as the sections for sequential playback; toolkit). The copy of the tree is serialized to XUK in memory and the XUK-2-Z transformation is applied to the copy (Obi). As a result, the publish directory contains all the DAISY 3 files and the one audio file per section audio data; the original project and its data are left untouched. Questions: (1) does copying the entire tree work? (2) will cleanup really only affect our copy? (3) when will asset consolidation (one asset per section) work?

What? XUK to Z update
When? November
Who? Julien, Marisa
And? Update the XSLT and transformation code for the XUK to Z export so that all new blocks are correctly handled (pages, skippable/escapable items, headings, NCX images, etc.)

What? Pre-release testing.
When? December
Who? All

What? Improve installer.
When? December
Who? Julien
And? Especially fix the .Net/DirectX issues.

What? Release 1.0.
When? Late December
Who? Julien
