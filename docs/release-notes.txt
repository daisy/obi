These release notes describe Obi version 0.8.0.0, released 2007-01-26.

NOTE TO TESTERS: please verify that every statement in this document is true
with regard to the distributed version of Obi.


1 Obi projects

  1.1 Obi can only open and save Obi projects, named with a .xuk extension.
  Obi projects for this version are identified by the version string
  "obi-xuk-009".

  1.2 Obi can export projects to DAISY ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 format.

  1.3 Only one project at a time can be open. Opening another project or
  creating a new project closes a previously open project.

  1.4 The clipboard (see below) is cleared when a project is closed, so that
  it is not possible to cut and paste between different projects.

  1.5 A project with modifications is never closed without prompting the user
  for saving changes, discarding them, or canceling the operation leading to
  closing the project.

  1.6 The title bar shows the title of the project currently open, followed by
  a star if it has unsaved modifications, and the name of the application. If
  no project is open only the name of the application is shown.


2 The TOC panel

  2.1 The TOC panel shows on the left-hand side of the project panel when a
  project is open. It can be either shown or hidden but is always shown when
  a project is open or created.

  2.2 The TOC panel shows the name of every section. The sections are organized
  in a hierarchical way (i.e. section, sub-section, etc.) and shown using a
  tree widget where every tree node corresponds to one section. The indenting
  of a node shows the section level. Nodes can be collapsed and expanded. Every
  section has a corresponding strip in the strip manager (see below) in the
  same order than in the tree.

  2.3 A used section shows in blue; an unused section shows is grayed-out. An
  unused section will not be exported to a DAISY book, and will not be played
  when the whole book plays.
  <LNN>The sections look the same in the TOC when they have focus, regardless
  of being marked as used or not. Is this a feature or a bug?</LNN>

  2.4 A section can be selected in the TOC panel by clicking it. It shows in
  white with a blue background.

  2.5 Operations on a section apply to all sub-sections of this section. For
  instance, deleting a section will delete all its sub-sections.

  2.6 New sections can be created by adding a sibling section (section of the
  same level) or a child section (sub-section.)
  <LNN>There is currently no way to insert a new section before the first child.
  The dicussed "insert before selected node" has seemingly not been implemented?
  </LNN>

    2.6.1 Adding a sibling section (TOC > Add section, or Ctrl+A) adds a new
    section immediately after the children of the selected section with the
    same level as the selected section, or appends a top-level section if no
    section is selected.

    2.6.2 Adding a child section (TOC > Add sub-section, or Ctrl+B) appends a
    new section under the currently selected section.
    [NOTE: there is an inconsistency between the two operations; the previous
    should probably append just like this one.]

    2.6.3 When a new section is created, it is given a default title. It is
    also immediately selected and given the focus for retitling.

  2.7 A selected section can be retitled (TOC > Rename section, or F2). The
  name cannot be the empty string.

  2.8 A selected section level can change by moving it in or out.

    2.8.1 Moving a section out (TOC > Move section out, or Ctrl+Shift+Left) 
    reduces its level by one. Instead of being a child of its parent, it
    becomes its sibling. A top-level section cannot be moved out.

    2.8.2 Moving a section in (TOC > Move section in, or Ctrl+Shift+Right)
    increases its level by one. It becomes a child of its preceding sibling.
    A section which is the first child of its parent cannot be moved in.

  2.9 A selected section can be cut (Edit > Cut section, or Ctrl+X). It is
  deleted from the project and placed in the clipboard for pasting.

  2.10 A selected section can be copied (Edit > Copy section, or Ctrl+C). It
  is placed on the clipboard for pasting.

  2.11 When the clipboard contains a section and a section is selected, then
  the section in the clipboard can be pasted as a new child of the selected
  section (Edit > Paste section, or Ctrl+V). The clipboard is unchanged, so
  that the same section can be pasted again.
  <LNN>Also here, paste should be "insert before selected" IMO</LNN>

  2.12 A selected section can be deleted (Edit > Delete section, or Del).

  2.13 A selected section can be marked as used or unused (TOC > Mark section
  as used / TOC > Mark section as unused, or Ctrl+K). All operations on section
  are disabled for unused sections, except marking them as used or showing them
  in the strip manager.
  [NOTE: this is not implemented correctly and consistently and will change
  soon.]

  2.14 A selected section can be shown in the strip manager (TOC > Show in
  strip view, or Alt+V). The corresponding strip is selected.

  2.15 Keyboard navigation is available in the TOC panel when it has focus.
  The behavior of the keyboard in this view is the one that is implemeted by
  the tree widget in Windows.


3 The strip view

  3.1 The strip view shows on the right-hand side of the project panel. It
  cannot be hidden but can be resized.
  <LNN>Only in relation to the TOC-view, right? Feels more like I'm resizing the 
  TOC than the strips, but it is OFC both...</LNN>

Appendix A - Missing features for version 1.0

  A.1 Keyboard navigation in the strip manager.

  A.2 Page numbering: when a page number is set on a phrase, Obi automatically
  assigns the page number (starting from 1 and counting upwards.) Adding or
  removing page numbers lead to automatic renumbering.

  A.3 Go to page: select the phrase with the given page number, if it exists.
  <LNN>A "Go to next page" function would also be nice to have.</LNN>

  A.4 Cut/copy/paste text from annotation is not available.
  <LNN> Sure it is, it interacts with the normal windows clipboard. Best guess 
  is that it's a gift from the edit function being a text box widget?</LNN>

  A.5 Search text: select a section whose title contains this text, or a phrase
  with an annotation containing this text. May move to post-0.9.

  A.6 "Save as" may be revised.

  A.7 User profile and preferences will be merged under a single "preferences"
  dialog.

  A.8 Unused item behavior may be too restrictive; maybe all operations should
  be allowed in unused sections and with unused audio blocks except that they
  won't be exported or played when the whole book plays.
  <LNN>I agree, it should be possible to do most of the normal types of work 
  on unused blocks. Otherwise, it is merely a "not really deleted yet" 
  functionality, and that feels more like the domain of undo/redo to me</LNN>
