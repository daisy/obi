Obi release notes
$Id$


These release notes describe Obi version 0.8.3.1, released 2007-03-09. The
goal of this document is to list all of the features of the latest version
of Obi, for developers, testers and users. See appendix C for the changelog.

NOTE TO TESTERS: please verify that every statement in this document is true
with regard to the distributed version of Obi.


Appendix A - Missing features for version 1.0 (unsorted)

  A.1 Cut/copy/paste text from annotation is not available.
  [NOTE: Actually it is, it interacts with the normal windows clipboard, as
  implemented by the text box widget. A better integration with Obi's
  clipboard is necessary though.]

  A.2 Search text: select a section whose title contains this text, or a
  phrase with an annotation containing this text. May move to post-0.9.

  A.3 User profile and preferences will be merged under a single
  "preferences" dialog. Menus will be reorganized a little.

  A.4 Unused item behavior may be too restrictive; maybe all operations
  should be allowed in unused sections and with unused audio blocks except
  that they won't be exported or played when the whole book plays.

  A.5 The help file is badly outdated. Release notes are still a draft too.

  A.6 The transport bar buttons will be disabled when necessary, i.e. on
  the first section the "previous section" button will be disabled but if
  there is more than one section, the "next section" button will be enabled.

  A.7 The time display will allow input to directly go to a selected time
  in the book.


Appendix B - Known Issues
[NOTE: there are really many more than that!]

  B.1 Project audio is lost after export.

  B.2 Selection, especially when/after playing, is not always consistent.

  B.3 Recording has some issues with display (some times are displayed
  wrong), asset boundaries and page markers.

Appendix C - Changelog

  * New in Obi 0.8.3.1
    * Fixed a "view in strip manager" bug; there may remain some related
    problems with strips.
    * Reallowed shortcuts with "focus on strip" (e.g. arrows.)
    * Hide "no project" label in the project panel when a project is open;
    shouldn't be picked up by screen readers (to be tested.)
    * Recording mostly works but display is not really good yet. Behavior of
    page marker dropping is a bit strange.

  * New in Obi 0.8.3.0
    * Cleaned-up menu accelerator keys.
    * Added "Strips > Go to page".
    * Selection follows focus (when tabbing.)
    * Focus follows selection (useful for screen readers.)
    * Added "focus on annotation" (useful for screen readers too.)
    * Default file names allow more characters (e.g. Japanese.)
    * Deleting the text of annotation is the same as removing the
    annotation (no more warnings about empty annotations.)
    * Editing and removing annotations can be undone and modifies the
    project.

  * New in Obi 0.8.2.0
    * Fixed some keyboard navigation bugs (but splitter in project panel is
    still inacessible with keyboard.)
    * Help can be opened in external browser.

  * New in Obi 0.8.1.0
    * "TOC > Add section" changed to "TOC > Insert section".
    * Set/remove pages added, need to be written up by Julien.
    * Changed audio block display to say "Audio block 1 of 3" or "page 5".
    * Keyboard navigation in the strip manager (relies on screen reader)
    * Separated play and pause buttons in the transport bar, and switched
    stop and record buttons. Modified transport menu accordingly.
    * Installer installs shortcut and desktop icon.
