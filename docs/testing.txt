Testing Obi
$Id$


* Testers are expected to test this
# Developers are expected to test this


Testing the manual
[NOTE: this will apply when the manual is brought in sync with Obi.]

  * Read through the manual while Obi is open. The manual can be read from
    inside Obi (press F1 or Help > Contents), or on the web
    (http://urakawa.sourceforge.net/obi/user-manual)

    * For each heading, check that the mentioned functionality can be found in
      Obi.

    * For each image, check that the Obi GUI looks like the screendump.

    * For each non-common word and/or acronym, check that it is explained in
    the Glossary.

    * For each shortcut key mentioned, assert that it performs the described
      action (Be sensible here, e.g. do not expect the shortcut for "Redo" to do
      anything when you have not used undo.) Check that the shortcut mention
      in the manual matches the GUI.

  * Navigate the main menu
  
    * For each clickable menu item, check that it can be found in the manual.
      Fully detailed description should not be expected, but each point should
      in some manner at least be mentioned.
    
    * For each disabled menu item, assert that the manual gives a plausible
      reason why this item might be disabled.

  * Test the accessibility of the manual (e.g. by reading through a screen
    reader or text browser.)

  * Report typos.

  # Make sure that the manual is valid HTML, valid CSS, etc.
  
Testing the installer.

  # Test that the installer executes on a newly installed WinXP box.
  # Test that the installer fails gracefully when .NET 2.0 has not been intalled.
  # Test that the installer runs with the .NET 2.0 runtime, not the SDK version.
  # Test that the installed Obi runs with the .NET 2.0 runtime, not the SDK version.
  * Test that Obi can be installed and executed on a machine that has .NET 2.0 and the latest DirectX installed.


Testing the app
 
  * Testing the Menus

    * File Menu:
      * Create a new project.
      * Create a project with the same name, overwriting the previous one.
      * Create a project by typing in a path including folder names that do no exist.
      * Open a project by using "File -> Open Project"
      * Open a project by using "File -> Open recent project"
      * Test that "File -> Open recent project -> Clear list" actually clears the list, and that it remains clear after restarting Obi.
      * Test that opening a project in either way fails gracefully when attempting to open a non-valid XUK file
      * Save project
      * Save project as...
      * Discard changes, and assert that the result is the same as reopening the last saved file.
      * Copy something, close project, create new project, then check that pasting is not possible.
      * Edit something, then check that "File -> Exit" propts you to save before exiting.
      * Save current project, then "File -> Exit", making sure that you aren't prompted for saving changes.

    * Edit menu
      * Test that undo is available after you edit anything,
      * Test that Redo is available after undoing something.
      * Test that Undo/Redo works for...
        - Creating a new section/strip
          [NOTE: when a strip or section is first created, it gets the default name "Untitled section". If you create a new section and give it a name, undoing will first undo the name change, then another undo will remove the section.]
        - Deleting a section/strip
        - Renaming a section [see note above for new sections.]
        - Moving sections in and out. Be careful that the hierarchy of sections is correctly restored after undoing (especially for move out.)
        - Importing audio in a strip
        - Recording audio to a strip
        - Deleting audio from a strip
        - Adding a page number mark to a phrase
        - Removing a pagenumber mark
        - Cut and copy (the previous contents of the clipboard should be restored after undoing cut or copy.)
      * Test that selection makes sense after undo/redo.
      * Test that undo/redo is disabled when audio is playing.
      * Test that undo/redo is enabled when audio is playing but that playback stops before undoing or redoing.
      * Test that Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete works for...
        - sections
        - strips
        - audio blocks
        - annotation text
      * Test that paste is only enabled when the clipboard contains an item, and that it can be pasted in the current context. Conversely, test that paste is always enabled when the clipboard contains an item that can be pasted in the current context.
      * Test that metadata can be edited, and that it persists after saving the project, closing Obi, reopening Obi, reloading the project.
      * Test that "touch project" enables the "Save command in the File menu.

    * TOC menu
      * Check again that TOC is explained in the manual.
      * Test that TOC hide/show works, and that the contents+focus remains the same.
      * Test that no modification is enabled while the TOC does not have focus.
      * Test that no modification is enabled in the TOC when audio is playing.
      * Test that modification is enabled when audio is paused and that playback is stopped before such modification takes place.
      * Test that the first child of a parent can not be moved further in
      * Test that the left-most TOC items can not be moved further out
      * Test that used/unused works for the correct strips according to the selected section node in the TOC.
      * Test that "Show in strip view" selects the correct strip.

    * Strips menu
      * Test that "Add strip" adds a new strip before the one that has focus
      * Test that "Rename strip" is enabled when a strip has focus.
      * Test that "Rename strip" allows editing of a strip, and that the correct TOC item also changes name.
      * Test that "Mark strip as unused"...
        - shows the strip distictly different from a normal (/used) strip
        - appears as "unused" to compensating programs (such as JAWS)
        - causes the content of the strip to be excluded from the result of "File -> Export as Daisy".
      * Test that "Import audio file" doesn't allow invalid files to be selected (at least the file name extension should be one supported by the current version of Obi)
      * Test that "Import audion file" creates an audio block...
        - before the currently selected audio block if an audio block is in focus
        - at the end of the currently selected strip if a strip is in focus
      * Test that "Import audio file" isn't enabled when neither a strip nor an audio block has focus

         - is not enabled "Forwards" when the focus is on the last audio block of a strip
         - is not enabled "Backwards" when the focus is on the last audio block of a strip
         [NOTE: forwards/backwards looks to me like they have been reversed naming-wise, but the keys behave like I would want them to]
      * Test that "Mark audio block as unused"
        - is enabled when an audio block has focus.
        - is labeled "Mark audio block as used" when an audio block that has already been marked "unused" has focus.

      * Test that "Remove page number"...
        - is enabled only when an audio block has focus, and that audio block has a page number
        - removes the page number.
      * Test that "Show in TOC view" places the focus on the section in the TOC view that best matches the current selection in the strip view.

  * Split Dialog
  [Note: The user is informed that he is splitting a named asset, but this asset name should in theory not be available anywhere. As a minimum, I would suggest showing the annotation to the asset instead of the name of the asset. Better yet might be to skip any other description of the asset, than what is available by pressing play?]
