# Obi tasklist for version 1.0

`$Id$`

This document covers the tasklist for Obi in versions 0.8.5.1 (May 2007) to
1.0 (hopefully December.) Most tasks come from [the requirement list for
version 2.0](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm) which is
really going to be version 1.0.

## In progress

### Specification of audio for section headings

* Julien
* [Requirement #12](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm#f12)
* TODO: custom sequence of phrases instead of a single phrase. Reading from
[the spec of the `<audio>`
element](http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html#NCXElem), it seems
that we can use a sequence of contiguous audio blocks; this should be easy
to do once we do multiple selection.

### Switch between states at a single key-press

* Avneesh. Time: Will be taken up and completed with modifying of playback
*[Requirement #9](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm#f9)

### Phrase detection

* Arguably could be much better, but we need testing and feedback to improve
it.
* TODO: improve the selection of silence chunk.
* TODO: implement better algorithm.
* [Requirement #14](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm#f14)

### Project cleanup

* Marisa
* [Requirement #11](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm#f11)
* This has been implemented and separated from the export function, although the export function still includes cleanup
* One open issue is that when Project.CleanProjectAssets fails, there is still a temporary asset directory.  We need to remove this and ensure a roll-back to a pre-cleaned up state.

### Import of predefined TOC structure

* Marisa
* [Requirement #23](../../common/ObiRequirements/Obi2_0Requirements.htm#f23)
* This has been partially implemented as something that reads in an XHTML document and creates section nodes for each heading
* Some minor bugs are still there
* Any issue surrounding empty audio blocks has not been addressed yet
* The input XHTML must be well-formed, contain one or more headings, and have the headings in the correct order (i.e., h2 has to come between h1 and h3).
