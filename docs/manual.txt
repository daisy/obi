# Mockup of Obi 1.0 manual

`$Id$`

<div id="toc">Table of contents</div>

The idea is that we document features first, then implement them. This way
we can better test if they behave as planned and we don't have to document
them later. This file can be the basis for the proper help page (with
screenshots, with more end-user hand-holding) with the objective of reusing
as much of it as possible.

## What is Obi?

## The work area

The work area shows the whole project at once and allows the user to focus
on specific parts while editing, recording and testing playback of a
project.

Sketch of the work area:

### Metadata view

The metadata view can be shown under the TOC view or instead of the strips
view. Maybe a condensed version if a sidebar?

### The table of contents view

Hierarchy of the project. Synchronized with the Strip view. (This could be
an option.)

### Strips view

Shows strips and blocks.

#### Strips

Strips are containers for blocks and map one-to-one with sections. They are
composed of:

* The name of the section (same as shown in the TOC view, changing one
changes the other.)

* The thumbnail of the section image (can be shown full-size in a modal
window, and/or in the sidebar Ã  la iTunes?)

* The audio blocks, see below.

Unused strips are kept in the project but 

Strips may be indented/collapsed?

#### Blocks

All blocks belong to one of the following class:

* Plain audio block: this is the regular kind of audio blocks. They have a
wave-form display.

* Page block: a block with a page number (can be automatic or manually
assigned.)

* Heading block: represents the heading for the section strip that it
belongs to.

* Escapable block: marked as escapable in the SMIL output. (See Z spec
section 7.4.1)

* Skippable block: can be skipped by default.

* Group block: a group block contains one or more blocks of the same kind
which all share the same properties.

* Also: footnotes and references, producer notes, custom blocks.

All of these blocks can have the following properties:

* Empty or non-empty: the block has audio data or not. An empty block has no
wave-form display, naturally, but has two buttons or links to import or
record audio data into it.

* Used or unused: unused blocks are kept in the project but are not exported
and skipped during playback (unless explicitely played.)

* Annotation: any block can have a free-text annotation. This is a
production time feature. The user can 

### Transport bar

Used for recording and QA playback. Buttons are overloaded for recording;
for instance, the next phrase button introduces a new phrase. Whether this is
sufficient remains to be seen. An idea would be to modify the toolbar when
recording.

### VU meter

Has its own window, or is part of the transport bar (text/small version.)
