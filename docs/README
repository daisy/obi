Obi 0.10.2 (1.0 Alpha) release notes

INSTALLATION

* You need to install the DirectX End-User Runtime. This link should work:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&DisplayLang=en


When the DirectX end-user runtime is installed, you can launch the Obi
installer.

* You also need to install the .Net Framework 2.0; if it is not installed on
  your machine the installer will complain and will take you to a page where
  you can download and install it. The link is out-of-date but the obsolete
  page redirects you to a current one. When .Net is installed, you will need
  to relaunch the installer.


MISSING FEATURES: these will be completed very soon; then we'll have a beta
version.

* The manual is incomplete, but you can still read what we have by choosing
  Help > Contents in Obi, or pressing F1.

* The metadata panel is missing (it is currently empty.)

* Export only exports audio.

* Some features are temporarily disabled (selection during playback, making
  blocks unused...)
