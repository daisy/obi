This is the new list of features with a timeline for iteration 2, spanning
four months (early september 2006 to early january 2007) and leading to the
pre-release of version 1.0 of Obi.


Version 0.6 -- various fixes -- mid-October 2006 (Friday Oct 13th)

[ ] Sync helpfile with version published on the website. Daniel made a
proposal. Julien and Markus will look at it.

[ ] Fix channels creation when reading in XUK file. [Julien]

[ ] Strip information field; maybe change font sizes for strip names?
[Marisa]

[ ] Remove move section up/down (use cut/paste instead.) [Marisa]

[ ] Update commands (user visible flag; composite commands.) Fix the add
section/rename command? [Julien and Marisa]

[ ] Fix pages to be numbers; use property instead of child node. [Julien]

[ ] Subclass core nodes (ObiNode > { SectionNode, PhraseNode }) -- depends
on CoreNodeFactory, due October 9th.
Julien creates a branch and the base classes; then Marisa and Julien update
the code to reflect the change. Decide on the order of child nodes of
sections.

[ ] Simple read-only views for positioning, navigation... [Julien]

[ ] Replace phrase annotations with annotation strip. Make phrase size
function of audio length. [Julien or Marisa]

[ ] Fix keyboard navigation (tabbing between views, arrows inside views.)
[Julien or Marisa]


Version 0.7 -- audio work -- early November 2006 (Friday November 3rd)

[ ] Transport bar: cursor; play one block/play continuously; move in time
and in structure. Pause, stop, record. Rwd/Fwd get faster.

[ ] Time display when playing and paused (in book/in block.)

[ ] VU Meter.

[ ] Phrase detection (and trim?)

[ ] Live phrase creation.

[ ] Live page marking: same as phrase except also creates a page item (one
plus number of previous page.)

[ ] Audio scratchpad.


Version 0.8 -- DAISY features -- early December 2006

[ ] Used/unused blocks and blocks missing asset. (Unplayable)

[ ] Header block (in the structure strip, can be anywhere but not a page.)

[ ] Full DAISY metadata.

[ ] Cut/copy/paste moves to Edit menu; interface Windows clipboard with Obi
clipboard. Maintain a clipboard for blocks, sections and text; use depending
on context.

[ ] Search text feature (in sections, in annotations, in metadata?)

[ ] Go to page and page autonumbering.

[ ] Split and merge sections.

[ ] Zed native export.


Version 0.9 -- polishing -- early January 2007

[ ] Localizations: Japanese locally; organize Thai localization after Delhi
meeting or before Phuket?

[ ] Progress bar for long operations.

[ ] Strip collapsing. (Automatically?)

[ ] Better installer, choose location of install.

[ ] Customizable fonts, size and family.

[ ] Review color scheme.

[ ] Contextual help.

[ ] Templates (read-only files for starting projects.)

[ ] Images in an image strip (notably for NCX images.)

[ ] Full-text with external text editing.

[ ] Multiple selections.

[ ] Wave display and visual audio editing.

[ ] Drag and drop items.

[ ] Resources and resource manager; multi-project editing; cut/copy/paste
between projects (nodes *and* assets.)

Obsolete list for reference:

Iteration 1 bugs and missing features

  * Keyboard navigation with tab key is insufficient and broken.
  * Some shortcuts do not work properly.
  * Audio stuttering after a while.
  * VU meter is not available.
  * Simple metadata only.
  * Single command for add section/rename if done in one go (tricky.)
  * Update the cons command (see shallow delete)
  

Iteration 2 features

  * Arrow navigation in the strip view similar to the tree view. Tab to move
  only inside the project view?

  * Changes to the internal tree: section nodes have exactly two children,
  the first is a section list node, and the second a phrase list node. The
  section list node has as many children as the section has subsections; the
  phrase list node has as many children as the section has phrases. The root
  node is then actually a section list node. When serializing, these nodes
  are removed, and recreated when loading a XUK file.

  * Split and merge sections (?) -- split a section after a phrase; create a
  new child section with the following phrases. Merge a section with its
  first child or next sibling if it has no children; append the phrase
  contents to the section's contents, as well as the children.

  * Transport bar for audio playing. Ability to move in time inside blocks
  and strips, from block to block, from strip to strip. Play a block, a
  strip or the whole book. Play, record and split from the transport bar
  instead of dedicated dialogs. Mark phrases/pages while recording (two
  transport bar buttons.) Mark sections as well?

  * Toolbar with buttons for common operations?

  * Display of wave forms inside blocks. The size of a block is then
  relative to its length. A zoom factor (per strip and per book) can be set.
  Wave display can be turned on and off (but the size of strips is still
  relative to the audio length, not label length any more.) Mouse operations
  are available when wave display is on.

  * Audio scratchpad: a special kind of strip where new audio blocks can be
  imported or (usually) recorded before being moved to an actual strip.

  * Phrase detection: this is available in the audio backend but we need to
  define a simple enough interface for the user. The problem is that the
  parameters for silence detection are not easy to set directly, use by example
  is better. One simple possibility is to use the beginning/ending of assets
  which probably have silence, and instruct the user to leave a few seconds
  of leading and trailing silence when recording; maybe with a flag that tells
  the user when to start/stop? This should be less intrusive than the dreaded
  calibration process.

  * Used and unused blocks: a block can be marked as unused and will be
  skipped when playing, and not exported when making a book. Cleaning up of
  unused block is also possible (all unused audio data will be deleted.)

  * Invalid assets: audio blocks with assets that cannot be read are kepts
  but are marked as invalid (same as unused) until a correct asset is
  recorded or added. (Can be done by selecting after and merging?)
  
  * Heading blocks: one block per strip is designated as the heading block.
  This is the first block that plays for this strip, so all blocks before
  this one are marked as unused.

  * Full DAISY metadata: only simple metadata at the moment, add a new tab
  to the metadata dialog to edit actual, full DAISY metadata.

  * Native DAISY 3 DTB export: produce a complete DTB fileset from within
  Obi (using only used blocks.)

  * Search function: all text (metadata, block labels, page labels, heading
  titles) is searchable. How to display the results though?

  * Cut/copy/paste in the edit menu works for text stuff (labels, titles,
  etc.)

  * Show a progress bar for long operations (e.g. opening a book.)

  * Color and font schemes, hopefully customizable?

  * Contextual help (to be specified.)

  * 0.6 (late September): fixes
    + fix keyboard navigation and shortcuts
    + architecture review (tree, simplify events?, recording without
    temporary file.)
    + split/merge sections

    + remove move up/down; review paste

  * 0.7 (late October/early November): audio
    + transport bar
    + VU meter
    + audio scratchpad
    + live phrase marking

  * 0.8 (late November/early December): DAISY
    + used/unused blocks and invalid assets
    + header block
    + full DAISY metadata
    + search feature
    + cut/copy/paste for text
    + page autonumbering and live page marking [fix pages]
    + go to page
    + phrase detection

  * 0.9 (late December/early January): polishing
    + localizations (French, Japanese, Thai?)
    + Daisy 3 native export
    + progress bar for long operations
    + friendlier installer (can choose where to install for instance.)
    + color/font scheme
    + contextual help

  * 1.0 (February)
    + fix stuff so that it looks like a version 1.0


Future features (post-1.0)

  * Text: every phrase block may have a text block. The text is unformatted
  (although we may consider SMIL Text, depending on how it goes?) Text nodes
  are children of phrase nodes (phrase is master.)

  * Images: every phrase block may have an image block. TOC items may have
  images too if the associated phrase has an image. Image nodes are children
  of phrase nodes (phrase is master)

  * (Synchronize the above points with AMIS to make sure that the created
  content can be played correctly.)

  * Select more than one item at once: span of phrases; chunk of TOC; etc.

  * Drag/drop stuff: drag blocks to move them inside and between strips;
  sections inside the toc or the strip view.

  * Resources and resource manager, or at least taking resources from one
  project to another -> copy/paste between projects.

  * Navlists.

  * Skippable and escapable structures; probably need a new container
  element (like a div.)
