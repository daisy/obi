This is the new list of features with a timeline for iteration 2, spanning
four months (early september 2006 to early january 2007) and leading to the
pre-release of version 1.0 of Obi.


Iteration 1 bugs and missing features

  * Keyboard navigation with tab key is insufficient and broken.
  * Some shortcuts do not work properly.
  * Audio stuttering after a while.
  * VU meter is not available.
  * Simple metadata only.
  

Iteration 2 features

  * Arrow navigation in the strip view similar to the tree view. Tab to move
  only inside the project view?

  * Changes to the internal tree: section nodes have exactly two children,
  the first is a section list node, and the second a phrase list node. The
  section list node has as many children as the section has subsections; the
  phrase list node has as many children as the section has phrases. The root
  node is then actually a section list node. When serializing, these nodes
  are removed, and recreated when loading a XUK file.

  * Split and merge sections (?) -- split a section after a phrase; create a
  new child section with the following phrases. Merge a section with its
  first child or next sibling if it has no children; append the phrase
  contents to the section's contents, as well as the children.

  * Transport bar for audio playing. Ability to move in time inside blocks
  and strips, from block to block, from strip to strip. Play a block, a
  strip or the whole book. Play, record and split from the transport bar
  instead of dedicated dialogs. Mark phrases/pages while recording (two
  transport bar buttons.) Mark sections as well?

  * Toolbar with buttons for common operations?

  * Display of wave forms inside blocks. The size of a block is then
  relative to its length. A zoom factor (per strip and per book) can be set.
  Wave display can be turned on and off (but the size of strips is still
  relative to the audio length, not label length any more.) Mouse operations
  are available when wave display is on.

  * Used and unused blocks: a block can be marked as unused and will be
  skipped when playing, and not exported when making a book. Cleaning up of
  unused block is also possible (all unused audio data will be deleted.)

  * Invalid assets: audio blocks with assets that cannot be read are kepts
  but are marked as invalid (same as unused) until a correct asset is
  recorded or added. (Can be done by selecting after and merging?)
  
  * Heading blocks: one block per strip is designated as the heading block.
  This is the first block that plays for this strip, so all blocks before
  this one are marked as unused.

  * Full DAISY metadata: only simple metadata at the moment, add a new tab
  to the metadata dialog to edit actual, full DAISY metadata.

  * Native DAISY 3 DTB export: produce a complete DTB fileset from within
  Obi (using only used blocks.)

  * Search function: all text (metadata, block labels, page labels, heading
  titles) is searchable. How to display the results though?

  * Show a progress bar for long operations (e.g. opening a book.)

  * Color and font schemes, hopefully customizable?
