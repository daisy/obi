    <h2 id="id53302">Selection basics</h2>
    <p>We need a behavior that is consistent with user expectations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click to select one item; previous selection is deselected.</li>
      <li>Dragging to select multiple items.</li>
      <li>Shift+Click to select a range.</li>
      <li>Ctrl+Click to select items one by one: each new item is added to the
selection.</li>
      <li>Click anywhere unselectable to deselect.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We need a mechanism for keyboard selection.</p>
    <p>Menu items that are usually present:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select all: select all sections in the TOC view, select all section strips
in the strip view.</li>
      <li>Deselect: deselect anything that was selected.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="id53354">Selecting different kinds of items</h2>
    <h3 id="id53358">Section selection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the TOC.</li>
      <li>The whole subtree is selected.</li>
      <li>Multiple selection is restricted to sections of the same level, but
non-contiguous selection is possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id53377">Block selection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the strip/block view.</li>
      <li>It is not the same to select all the blocks in a strip or a container
block, and the strip or container block itself.</li>
      <li>Multiple selection: only blocks in the same container can be selected
together.
<ul><li>Only blocks inside the same strip can be selected together.</li><li>A container block must be selected in full if it is in the same
selection than other blocks.</li><li>Non-contiguous selection is possible.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id53413">Text selection</h3>
    <p>Text selection is handled automatically. No multiple selection.</p>
    <h3 id="id53421">Waveform selection</h3>
    <p>Waveform selection is similar to text selection. No multiple selection. We
must clearly show the difference between selecting the waveform for a block
and the block itself (it is not the same of course!)</p>
    <h2 id="id53431">Selection and command management</h2>
    <p>Undo and redo should restore the state of the project to what what it was
just before the command was issued (undo) or just after it is issued (redo),
so there is a tight relationship between commands and selection. Namely, the
commands should store the selection for restoring it when undoing.</p>
    <p>Selecting something can itself be a command, and thus can be undone and
redone. We would need to test this feature as it may lead to overcrowding
the command stack, but it is useful, especially when we deal with editing of
wave form.</p>
