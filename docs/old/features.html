    <h1>Obi feature list for iterations 1 and 2</h1>
    <p>Julien Quint (ed.), Marisa de Meglio, Markus Gylling</p>

<p>This is an edited version of the feature list decided in Amsterdam in July
2006. The plan for iteration 1 is to reach version 0.5 of the application,
where most backend features are implemented (i.e. the application is
functional) but the graphical interface is deliberately unpolished (e.g. no
display of waveform.) Version 1.0 is to be reached by iteration 2, where the
goal is to deliver a fully-usable and documented beta version of Obi with a
somewhat rich, but accessible, GUI. High-level features list:</p>

<ul>
<li>NCX-only book editing with limited support for navpoint labels; support
    for pages but not for navlists.</li>
<li>Uncompressed audio support (RIFF/WAVE), with live recording and
    accessible audio editing and synchronization functionality.</li>
<li>Full accessibility and internationalization.</li>
<li>That's pretty much it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Iteration 1</h2>

<p>Version 0.5 focuses on audio rather than graphics, to emphasize the audio
aspect and the accessibility of the application (and also shorten
development time.) This will also serve as a testbed to see how abstract the
graphical representation of the project elements can be.</p>

<p class="in">The application has two main view of the book&mdash;tree view and strip view.</p>

<p><strong>Table of contents is a tree view:</strong>
each node in the tree is a section, child
nodes are subsections, and so on. This view behaves like a tree: deleting a
section node will delete all of its descendants. Moving a node will move the
descendants as well, etc.</p>

<p class="in">This view allows the editor of the book to focus on the structure. No
recording takes place in this view, but when audio assets are associated with
headings, they should be playable here.</p>

<p><strong>Book content is a strip view:</strong>
each section is represented in a strip. The
strip view shows a flat list of strips. Such section strips contains all the
contents of the section: its heading, every phrase, and page numbers.</p>

<p class="in">Strips can be added, moved and deleted in this view just like in the tree
view, however the semantics of the operations are different. For instance,
deleting a strip does not delete its subsections, but rather reattaches them
to other sections or changes their level to keep the table of contents in a
valid state (NCX-wise.)</p>

<p class="in">A section strip itself contains two strips: an audio strip and a
synchronization strip. These strips can contain blocks which are resp.
audio blocks and synchronization blocks. These blocks are atomic units that
can be moved around, cut/copied/pasted, added and deleted, and have some
other type-specific operations.</p>

<p class="in">The audio strip contains audio blocks which are phrases, the elements of
local navigation in DAISY books. Audio blocks can be set, which can be split
and merged with other assets. There are no gaps between blocks (the strip is
continuous.) In version 0.5, a block is a black box&mdash;we don't see what's
inside. Blocks can be annotated; the annotation is a string ot text that is
displayed in the block. It can be the text of the phrase ("The tsunami will
hit several times. Zaboom! Zaboom!") or a short description ("jack speaks
#1/3".) Annotations are not exported to a DAISY book but are saved by Obi
for future use. An audio strip contains zero or more audio blocks.</p>

<p class="in">The synchronization strip is a strip where we add a heading (exactly one
per strip) and page blocks (zero or more.) The two strips run parallel and
every phrase starting point creates a synchronization point. Putting a
synchronization block (heading or page) at a synchronization point effectively
synchronizes the item with the phrase: this will give an audio phrase for the
heading or the page number. There can be zero or one item at every
synchronization point.</p>

<p class="in">Phrases have three possible states: synchronized, regular, or unused. Regular
phrases are unsynchronized. Unused phrases are kept in the project but will be
deleted when cleaning up. Heading phrases (i.e. synchronized with a heading)
cannot be marked as unused but page phrases can. When unmarked, they become
synchronized again.</p>

<p class="in"><em>Synchronization of a heading:</em>
there is always a heading block in the
synchronization strip. Its label is the same in the tree and in the
synchronization strip. It can be changed from either. The heading block can
be moved to any free synchronization point in the strip.</p>

<p class="in"><em>Synchronization of a page:</em>
the page is inserted at the selected block's
synchronization point. If there is no selected block or the selected one is
not free, use the first following free one. A section strip must be selected.
Page blocks can be moved to any free point. Page blocks can be deleted.
Default value: 1 higher than previous.</p>

<p><strong>Audio management:</strong>
the application is able to import audio files (WAVE only,
uncompressed) into an audio strip or record live audio (same format.)
Insertion of audio happens at the end of an audio or after a selected phrase.
Audio blocks are never overwritten&mdash;they have to be explicitly deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Metadata:</strong>
the metadata is very simple and does not include the full set of
metadata mandated by the DAISY standard.</p>

<p><strong>QA playback:</strong>
Obi implements its own crude QA player. Can play the book, a
complete strip, or a single phrase. When playing a book or a strip, the unused
blocks are skipped. Possibility to play at higher or lower speed, but pitch
changes. Three time counters: book time, strip time, asset time.</p>

<p><strong>Markers:</strong>
phrase markers can be dropped on the fly while recording to create
new phrase blocks.</p>

<p>Keyboard navigation with single key. Deemphasize mouse usage.</p>

<h3>Timeline sketch for July 10th&mdash;August 18th (end of iteration 1)</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>07/10: Marisa and Markus rejoin the application team.</li>
  <li>07/11: Marisa and Julien do some coding in Amsterdam.</li>
  <li>07/17: Julien is back in Tokyo, works on tree view and strip manager shell
  with Zaboom in empty strips.</li>
  <li>07/24: Marisa works on tree view, Julien on strip view.</li>
  <li>07/28: Avneesh and Suman deliver milestone 2 of audio backend.</li>
  <li>07/31: Markus and Julien in Delhi work mainly on audio and asset manager with
  Avneesh and Suman.</li>
  <li>08/07: Julien back in Tokyo works on something or other.</li>
  <li>08/07: Markus back in Stockholm on usability, such as keyboard navigation
  and manual.</li>
  <li>08/18: Julien releases version 0.5 of the application then leaves on
          vacation.</li>
</ul>
  
  <h2>Iteration 2</h2>

  <p><strong>Actual DAISY metadata:</strong>
  this is not hard to but there are many attributes to
support. We can use a grid view: left is popup with name, other fields for
content.</p>

<p><strong>Some DAISY 3 features:</strong>
navlist maybe (probably not), skippable structures
(doable), resources (really not sure.) Those missing features can be part
of iteration 3; version 1.5 could add missing features, version 2 could be
addition of text.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical audio editing:</strong>
we display the waveforms inside the audio blocks,
and allow mouse selection for easier manipulation by sighted users. This will
be optional so that we can have a very simple non-visual editor if we want to.
Add zoom/unzoom, etc.</p>

<p>Strips can be collapsed to unclutter the strip view. Collapsing means we hide
the contents and keep only the label of the section strip.</p>

<p><strong>Search function:</strong>
all text contents (section labels, annotations, metadata)
can be searched.</p>

<p><strong>DAISY 3 export</strong>: natively export a DTB fileset from the
current project.</p>

<p>AMIS as a QA player?</p>

<p>Autonumbering of pages.</p>

<p><strong>Audio markers:</strong> on the fly page markers.</p>

<h3>Future features</h3>

<ul>
<li>DAISY 2/3 import/export through DMFC.</li>
<li>Text: unformatted text can be done quite easily, but synchronization
    with a DTBook document (other than extracting the structure) is
    difficult.</li>
  <li>Audio: support for compressed audio (e.g. MP3) and all of DAISY mandated
    formats. More functionality (e.g. change volume, filters, time
    stretching...) Add an audio scratchpad: at the moment, all audio content
    must be created through an audio strip; if we want to record/add audio
    contents it <strong>must</strong> go into an existing part of the book. The scratchpad
    would just keep audio assets that the project wants to use at some
    point.</li>
<li>Audio markers: on the fly headings.</li>
<li>Localization and RTL support (do wave forms go from right to left in RTL
applications?)</li>
  </ul>
