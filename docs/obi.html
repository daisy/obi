    <p><abbr title="Obi Backwards is Ibo">Obi</abbr>
    is a DAISY/NISO Digital Talking Book production tool. Obi was created
    to demonstrate the capabilities of the Urakawa toolkit as well as to
    provide an easy to use, accessible and internationalized DAISY production
    tool for everyone. Obi is free software; it is available at no cost and
    its source code is available for anyone to run, modify and redistribute. 
    Obi is released under the [insert actual licence here.]
    </p>

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <p>Obi is by design a simple tool with a small feature set:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for audio-only book editing with a table of contents (in
      DAISY terms, this means NCX-only DTBs.)</li>
      <li>Support for uncompressed RIFF/WAVE audio format only.</li>
      <li>Full accessibility and internationalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="editing">Editing concepts</h3> 
    <div style="float:right;margin-left:2em; width:400px">
      <p>
      <a href="../images/tsunami_screenshot.PNG">
        <img style="width:400px" src="../images/tsunami_screenshot.PNG"
        alt="Screenshot of Obi"/>
      </a>
      </p>
      <p class="lg">Editing a book in Obi. On the right the table of contents;
      on the left the four sections with their audio strips. The last section
      and its last audio block are currently selected.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
    This screenshot (click on the image to enlarge) shows the
    workspace in Obi. At its core, Obi is a structured audio editor; it is
    designed to manage <strong>phrases</strong>, which are the smallest
    navigation units in the book. As an atomic element, a phrase is represented
    by a <strong>block</strong> in the Obi workspace.
    </p>
    <p class="in">DAISY books have a structure which is called ``table of
    contents'' (or <strong>TOC</strong>) in Obi. The TOC is hierarchical and
    is represented as a tree view on the left side of the workspace. A node
    in this tree is a <strong>section</strong>. New sections and subsections
    can be added and moved around in the tree view.</p>
    <p class="in">Each section has contents, which are the aforementioned
    phrases. The audio blocks for the phrases are arranged in
    <strong>strips</strong> which can be seen in the strip view on the right
    side of the workspace. Blocks in strips can be moved, copied, split
    and merged. New audio content is added either by importing existing
    audio files, or recording new audio directly from Obi.</p>
    <p class="in">A complete manual is distributed with Obi and is accessible
    in the application through the Help menu, or by pressing F1 at any
    time.</p>
    
    <h3 id="download" style="clear:both">Download</h3>
    <p>
    Obi 0.5 is available for download for Microsoft Windows (currently tested
    under Windows XP only.) You will need the .Net framework 2.0 as well as
    Direct X 9 to make it run. Important note: this is an early release
    that still contains many bugs and misses a lot of features. Projects
    edited with this version are not guaranteed to be editable in future
    versions; integrity of data is not guaranteed either. This release is
    meant for testing and gathering feedback only, so use at your own risks.
    Bug reports and usability criticisms are most welcome and actually
    encouraged.
    </p>
    <p class="download"><a href="#">Download Obi 0.5 now</a>. Thank you for
    downloading Obi! If you are using this release, we would like to hear from
    you [insert contact e-mail here.]</p>
    <p>You can also download the source code for Obi and the Urakawa toolkit
    (which is used extensively by Obi) at the Urakawa project <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/urakawa">project page on
      Sourceforge</a> by using Subversion. More stable versions of Obi will
    have a source tarball distribution as well.</p>

    <h3 id="release">Release notes</h3>
    <p>Known problems, bugs and features (or lack thereof) in version 0.5
    include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keyboard navigation in the strip view uses the tab key only; it
      will use arrow keys instead.</li>
      <li>Some shortcuts are not working in some situation, or are wrong. Be
      careful with the delete key <code>:(</code></li>
      <li>No export to DAISY yet. Obi uses the Urakawa toolkit XUK format (XML
      for Urakawa) which can then be transformed to DAISY 2 or 3. Obi 1.0 will
      feature native DAISY 3 export.</li>
      <li>No QA player. Only single audio blocks can be played back.</li>
      <li>No transport bar either yet.</li>
      <li>No VU meter for playing and recording. This will be added in version
      1.0, along with the ability to change the recording volume.</li>
      <li>The application itself is English-only, but there is of course no
      restriction to the language of the audio. Unicode text is OK, but
      there is no right-to-left support yet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Missing features listed here are currently planned for inclusion by
    version 1.0, unless otherwise noted.</p>

    <h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
    <p>The next three releases of Obi are: a more stable alpha version (0.6) in
    late September, a beta version (0.9) in January 2007, with version 1.0 in
    early 2007. Version 1.0 should be available in other languages than
    English. Future versions will include more media support (text and
    images), DAISY features (skippable and escapable structures, resources,
    etc.) and internationalization features (right-to-left language support,
    more translations.)</p>
