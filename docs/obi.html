		<p><strong><acronym
	      title="Obi stands for &quot;Obi Backwards is Ibo;&quot; it is also 帯 in Japanese">Obi</acronym></strong> is a DAISY/NISO Digital Talking Book production tool. The Obi software was initially created to demonstrate the capabilities of the <a href="__section:SDK,subsection:default__" title="__sectionTitle:SDK__">Urakawa SDK</a>. Since then, it has evolved into a powerful authoring tool, which is <strong>easy to use</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>internationalized</strong>.
			</p>

		<p>

			Obi is <strong>free</strong> software; it is available at no cost and its <strong>source code</strong> is available for anyone to run, modify and redistribute. Obi is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" title="The GNU LGPL license webpage"><strong>LGPL</strong> license</a>.
			</p>

		<p>
		The intended audience of Obi is the individual DAISY reader who wants to create her own DAISY contents. This includes, but is not restricted to, print-disabled users.
		</p>

	</div>

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<div id="www_features">

	<p><strong>Obi</strong> is by design a simple tool with a small feature set:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Support for audio-only book editing with a table of contents (in DAISY terms, this means NCX-only DTBs)</li>
	<li>Support for uncompressed RIFF/WAVE audio format only</li>
	<li>Full accessibility (keyboard navigation, support for screen readers)</li>
	<li>Internationalization</li>
	</ul>
</div>

    <h3 id="editing">Editing concepts</h3>

<div id="www_editing-concepts">

		<div style="float: right; text-align: center; width: 300px; margin-left: 10px;">

		<a rel="externalx" href="__$strRootHttpDir__images/obi_screenshot.png" title="full-size image"><img style="width:300px;height:200px;" src="__$strRootHttpDir__images/obi_screenshot.png" alt="Obi screenshot"/></a>

		<em>Editing a book in Obi. On the right the table of contents; on the left the four sections with their audio and structure strips. Page 1 is currently selected.</em>
		</div>

	<p>
		 This screenshot (click on the image to enlarge) shows the workspace in Obi. At its core, Obi is a structured audio editor; it is designed to manage <strong>phrases</strong>, which are the smallest navigation units in the book. As an atomic element, a phrase is represented by a <strong>block</strong> in the Obi workspace.
	</p>
	<p>
		DAISY books have a structure which is called “table of contents” (or <strong>TOC</strong>) in Obi. The TOC is hierarchical and is represented as a tree view on the left side of the workspace. A node in this tree is a <strong>section</strong>. New sections and subsections can be added and moved around in the tree view.
	</p>
	<p>

		Each section has contents, which are the aforementioned phrases. The audio blocks for the phrases are arranged in <strong>strips</strong> which can be seen in the strip view on the right side of the workspace. Blocks in strips can be moved, copied, split and merged. New audio content is added either by importing existing audio files, or recording new audio directly from Obi.
	</p>
	<p>

		Obi uses its own format to store projects (the format is XML based and called <strong>XUK</strong>) This means that Obi projects cannot be opened directly in a DAISY player, and conversely, Obi cannot open a random DAISY book for editing. This problem will be addressed by <a rel="external" href="http://daisymfc.sf.net/" title="The DMFC conversion tool">DMFC</a>, which will allow conversion to and from XUK, DAISY 2 and DAISY 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		A complete manual is distributed with Obi and is accessible in the application through the Help menu, or by pressing F1 at any time.

    <h3 id="release">Release notes</h3>

	<div id="www_v0.5">

		<p>
		Known problems, bugs and features (or lack thereof) in version <strong>0.5.4.927</strong> include:
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Keyboard navigation in the strip view uses the tab key only; it will use arrow keys instead.</li>
		    <li>Some shortcuts are not working in some situation, or are wrong. Be careful with the delete key :(</li>
		    <li>Only single audio blocks can be played back; no transport bar.</li>
		    <li>No display of waveforms for audio blocks. The abstract representation of sound is actually a feature, as it allows for a simpler and more accessible interface. However, waveform audio editing (e.g., selecting a chunk of audio with a mouse) is planned for version 1.0 of Obi, but will be an optional feature.</li>
		    <li>No VU meter for playing and recording. This will be added in version 1.0, along with the ability to change the recording volume.</li>
		    <li>The application itself is English-only, but there is of course no restriction to the language of the audio. Unicode text is OK, but there is no right-to-left support yet.</li>
		    <li>Accessibility support is still minimal. Users of screen-readers, braille displays and alternative input devices are welcome to send their feedback.</li>
		    <li>The Obi manual is currently in XHTML format; although we are trying to make it as accessible as possible, it is still text-only. In the future, the manual will be in DAISY format (and editable by Obi, of course.) It will also be more complete.</li>
		    <li>The only structure items are page numbers. The first phrase of every section is understood to be the heading for the section.</li>
		</ul>

</div>
	<div id="www_v1.0">

		<p>
		Version 1.0 of Obi <strong>will</strong> include the following features:
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>More DAISY metadata: currently there is only a very simple and incomplete subset (see the Edit metadata menu in Obi.)</li>
		    <li>Indenting strips to reflect the structure in the strips view, and collapsing strips to hide their contents in order to clear up the strip view.</li>
		    <li>Search function: all text contents (section labels, annotations of audio blocks, metadata) will be searchable.</li>
		    <li>Autonumbering of pages.</li>
		    <li>Dropping page markers on the fly while recording.</li>
		    <li>QA playing: more support for audio playing inside Obi, and interfacing with AMIS (http://amis.sf.net/) for playback of books.</li>
		    <li>Toolbar with buttons for most actions.</li>
		    <li>Native DAISY 3 export.</li>
		    <li>Support for invalid assets: when reading a project, if an asset file cannot be found, the project cannot be open. A better behavior is to create an invalid block, that has limited operations, so that the user can set a correct asset again and carry on with editing the book.</li>
		    <li>Opening large projects should bring up a progress bar and hide the project panel until it is ready to be shown.</li>
		    <li>Enabling and disabling phrases and section: a phrase or section can be marked as enabled or disabled. Disabled sections will not be exported or played back in normal QA playing mode, but the data is still available while authoring.</li>
		    <li>Translation to other languages than English.</li>
		    <li>Better color scheme, and more importantly, customizable color schemes with defaults for user with low vision requiring high contrast. The font sizes must be customizable as well to allow for large type.</li>
		</ul>
</div>

    <h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
	<div id="www_roadmap">

		<p>
			The next three releases of Obi are:
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>a fuller-featured <strong>alpha version (0.7)</strong> in mid-November</li>
				<li>a <strong>beta version (0.9)</strong> in January 2007</li>
				<li><strong>version 1.0</strong> in early 2007</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
		Future versions will include more media support (text and images), DAISY features (skippable and escapable structures, resources, etc.) and better internationalization (right-to-left language support, more translations.) We encourage the suggestion of additional features for post-1.0 versions of Obi, but we intend to keep it as simple as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the Urakawa toolkit is designed to be portable, Obi is unfortunately Windows-only at the moment and will stay so for the foreseeable future. We hope that Obi will inspire the development of other DAISY production tools for other platforms, and that the Urakawa toolkit will make such development easier.
