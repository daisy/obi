Obi feature list / Iteration 1
$Id$

This document lists the features of the application and their completion
status. They are numbered by category from A to F. Numbering is arbitrary.


A. Project/User management

  * Support for a single project at once.
  * Support for a single user.
  * The user profile helps with bibliographic metadata (see E.) and some
  preferences, such as recording levels (see C.), file management, etc.
  * A project on disk will consist of a XUK file and a directory containing
  the audio files and extra data.

  1. Create/import/export

  A001: Create a blank project.
        An new, empty project is created. Try to fill as much metadata as
        possible from the user profile. A project directory is created to
        contain all data.

  A002: Open an existing project from a XUK file.
        The XUK file is read. Assuming that it is correct (the parser should
        be forgiving anyway), a project directory is created if it couldn't
        be found.

  A003: Save the current project to a XUK file.
        Actually we probably need a directory where the audio files are
        stored (see Audio

  A004: Clean the current project.
        Remove all unreferenced audio and authoring cruft. This is done
        through the asset manager, but in this iteration it is outside of
        the scope of the toolkit (so no worry for the faÃ§ade API at this
        stage.)

  2. User profile

  * Have a user profile. The user profile allows to fill the bibliographic
  metadata easily. Generate the author name, publisher (author's
  organization), and language. The user is also the default narrator and
  producer.

  A005: Have a name for the user.
        The user inputs her name. This can probably be obtained from the OS?
        This is editable and optional.

  A006: Have an organization for the user.
        The user inputs the name of her organization. This is editable and
        optional.

  A007: Have a language for the user.
        Choose from a list, and transform the value to an ISO string. This
        can also be obtained from the OS probably.

  A008: Have an identifier template.
        Generated an identifier template from the user's name/organization.
        Example: tpb-mg-xxxxx, where xxxxx is replaced by a number
        increasing with each project. Editable but not optional. Can also be
        generated randomly if there is no information (e.g. xPr7uW-xxxxx.)
        

B. Strips management

  * The project has a list of strip.
  * Each strip corresponds to exactly one navpoint.
  * The strips are in the same order as the navpoints.
  * The strips are indented by the level of their corresponding navpoint.

  1. Strips (in general)

  2. Container strips (= par)

  3. Audio strips

  4. Label strips

  5. Scale strips

  6. Strip manager
  
  Bxxx: Append a new strip.
        The strip is added at the end of the project.

  Bxxx: Insert a new strip.
        The strip is inserted at a position chosen by the user.


C. Audio engine and asset manager

  * Events are provided by C#

  1. Assets, Audio assets and Asset manager

  2. Audio player

  3. Audio recorder

  4. VU Meter


D. NCX editor

  * The NCX editor has a tree view of the table of contents (navmap and
  navlists) of the project.


E. Metadata editor and viewer

  * Metadata is either editable or generated. The editable metadata is
  edited by the user, using its profile or other sources for default values
  when applicable. The generated metadata can be viewed.

  * Skipped: dc:Type, dc:Coverage.

  E001: Unique identifier for the project.
        We can generate an identifier automatically (from the user template)
        by incrementing a counter. This value is used for dc:Identifier and
        dtb:uid for SMIL files (this is probably handled by DMFC when it
        generates the files?)

  E002: Edit project title.
        For simplicity, the project title should be unique; the presentation
        itself can have several titles (in different languages presumably.)
        The project title is just a string, it has no set value for its
        language.

  E003: Edit presentation's titles.
        [dc:Title] Required.
        Get the first title from the project's title. The language is then
        unspecified, the user will have to specify a language herself,
        otherwise it will inherit its language value following XML's rules
        in the final .opf document. The user is also free to add alternative
        titles.

  E004: Edit the creators.
        [dc:Creator] Required. Other attributes: role and file-as.
        This concerns the creator of the contents of the book, this is not
        necessarily the user of the software so leave this blank by default
        (but require at least one value to be input.)

  E005: Edit the subjects.
        [dc:Subject] Optional.

  E006: Edit the descriptions.
        [dc:Description] Optional.

  E007: Edit the publishers.
        [dc:Publisher] Required.
        Since this is required, it defaults to the user's organization.

  E008: Edit the contributors.
        [dc:Contributor] Optional. Other attributes: role and file-as.

  E009: Edit the date.
        [dc:Date] Required. Other attributes: event. Format: YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
        Can use the creation's day date; use only one value and the
        dtb:revisionDate elements instead.

  E010: View format of the presentation.
        [dc:Format] Required. This cannot be changed, and must be "ANSI/NISO
        Z39.86-2005". But this is shown if necessary.

  E011: Set identifiers.
        [dc:Identifier] Required. Optional attribute: scheme. The first
        identifier is uneditable and synchronized with the project's
        identifier. In DTB terms, this identifier has the id "uid" and is
        referenced in the root element--I am not sure what it becomes in the
        XUK file format. Other identifiers can be added.

  E012: Set sources.
        [dc:Source] Optional.

  E013: Set languages.
        [dc:Language] Required. Get the first language from the user's
        profile. Allow only to input valid values.

  E014: Set relations.
        [dc:Relation] Optional.

  E015: Set rights.
        [dc:Rights] Optional.

  E016: Change the language of any piece of (DC) metadata.
        All meta attributes can have a language attribute (xml:lang.)

  E017: Set source date.
        [dtb:sourceDate] Optional, not repeatable. YYYY[-MM[-DD]].

  E018: Set source edition.
        [dtb:sourceDate] Optional, not repeatable.

  E019: Set source publisher.
        [dtb:sourcePublisher] Optional, not repeatable.

  E020: Set source rights.
        [dtb:sourceRights] Optional, not repeatable.

  E021: Set source title.
        [dtb:sourceTitle] Optional, not repeatable.
        Warn if same as project title or one of the presentation's titles.

  E022: View multimedia type.
        [dtb:multimediaType] Required, not repeatable.
        Always "AudioNCX".

  E023: View multimedia content.
        [dtb:multimediaContent] Required, not repeatable.
        Always "audio,text".

  E024: Set narrators.
        [dtb:narrator] Required, repeatable.
        First narrator defaults to user name.

  E025: Set producers.
        [dtb:narrator] Required, repeatable.
        First narrator defaults to user organization.

  E026: Set completion date.
        [dtb:producedDate] Required, not repeatable. YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
        Default to the day when the project is saved.

  E027: Increase revision, update revision date and description
        [dtb:revision] Optional, not repeatable.
        [dtb:revisionDate] Optional, not repeatable. YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
        [dtb:revisionDescription] Optional, not repeatable.
        Increase revision by one from previous revision (or start from 1)
        and set the default value of the revision to the current date.

  E028: View total time.
        [dtb:totalTime] Required, not repeatable. SMIL timing value.
        This value is auto-generated by the asset manager.

  E029: View audio format.
        [dtb:audioFormat] Optional, repeatable.
        Only value at the moment: "Linear PCM - RIFF WAVE format" (or should
        it be the MIME type "audio/xwav"?)
