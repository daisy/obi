# Obi 1.0 feature list

Obi is a free software DAISY/NISO NCX-only Digital Talking Book (DTB)
production tool. Obi is being developed as part of the Urakawa project,
where tools are developed to help developers build accessible multimedia
applications. Obi version 1.0 is scheduled to be released for Windows XP in
December 2007.

## Obi file format

Obi uses its own authoring format defined by the Urakawa SDK. A project can
be saved at any point during authoring and can be reopened for later
editing.

### Import

Obi can import an existing book structure and create a skeleton project
ready for recording. Through the DAISY Pipeline, Obi can open NCX-only DAISY
books for further recording and editing.

### Export

Obi can export projects to DAISY/NISO 2005 to be played in any DAISY player.
Through the DAISY pipeline, DAISY 2.02 books can also be exported.

## Book structure and table of contents

An Obi project is structured in sections, subsections, etc. Each section has
a title and audio contents. The structure of a book can be authored through
a tree view. The contents of each section are authored through a strips
view, where every strip represents a section laid out linearly.

The tree view supports the following editing features:

* Adding a new section
* Adding a new subsection to a section
* Changing the level of a section by moving it in (increasing its level) or
out (decreasing its level)
* Cutting a section
* Copying a section
* Pasting a section
* Deleting a section
* Marking sections as being used or unused
* Editing the title of a section

The structure can be created entirely within Obi or be imported from an
XHTML file when creating a new project. All operations described above have
effect on a section and all of its subsections (these are _deep_ edits.)

## Strips and blocks

### Strips

A strip represents a section in the book. Every strip corresponds to a
section in the table of contents. A strip shows the title of the section as
well as the audio contents in the form of a sequence of audio blocks. See
below for a detailed description of blocks.

The strips view supports the following editing features:

* Adding a new strip
* Cutting a strip
* Copying a strip
* Pasting a strip
* Deleting a strip
* Editing the title of the section for a strip
* Managing the audio contents through audio block editing

### Audio blocks

Audio blocks represent the actual audio content of the book. Every block is
a phrase which is the smallest navigation unit in the book. Obi defines the
following kinds of blocks:

* Plain audio block: this is the regular kind of audio blocks. They have a
wave-form display.

* Page block: a block with a page number (can be automatic or manually
assigned.)

* Heading block: represents the heading for the section strip that it
belongs to.

* Nested blocks: several blocks of the same kind and sharing the same
properties can be grouped together. Tables or lists can be authored using this
feature.

* Custom blocks: the author can create new blocks classes (such as sidebars
or producer notes) that can stand out.

All of these blocks can have the following properties:

* Empty or non-empty: the block has audio data or not. An empty block has no
wave-form display, naturally, but has two buttons or links to import or
record audio data into it.

* Used or unused: unused blocks are kept in the project but are not exported
and skipped during playback (unless explicitely played.)

* Annotation: any block can have a free-text annotation. This is a
production-time feature and is not exported to DAISY.

* Escapable block: mark a structure as being escapable; normally applies to
nested blocks.

* Skippable block: mark a block as being skippable; normally applies to all
blocks of the same kind.

The strips view supports the following editing features for blocks:

* Creating a new block from an audio file (audio import)
* Creating new blocks from live recording (see audio recording below)
* Cutting a block
* Copying a block
* Pasting a block
* Deleting a block
* Moving a block forward or backward
* Changing the kind and properties of a block

## Audio

Obi supports uncompressed RIFF/WAV audio. Through the DAISY Pipeline, audio
contents can be converted to MP3 or other audio formats that DAISY supports.
Audio contents can either be imported from existing files or recorded
directly within Obi. All audio contents within an Obi projects share the
same WAV format (sample rate, number of channels, etc.)

### Audio recording

Obi supports live recording of audio. There are two recording modes:

* Append mode: new audio contents are added to the book.
* Punch-in mode: mistakes can be quickly corrected by overwriting a portion
of audio.

Recording creates new audio blocks and sections. While recording, it is
possible to mark phrases, pages and sections, as well as custom blocks.

The input device used for recording can be set from within Obi.

### Audio playback

Obi can playback the content of a book allowing navigation similar to a
DAISY player:

* Play, pause, stop, fast-forward, rewind
* Previous/next section
* Previous/next phrase
* Previous/next page

For QA purposes, it is possible to play the whole book or just a selected
part of it (*e.g.* a block or a section.)

The output device used for playback can be set from within Obi.

### Audio editing

Obi is built with accessibility in mind and provides simple primitives for
non-visual audio editing:

* Split a block in two
* Merge two blocks into one
* Detect phrases inside a block and split it in as many blocks

Obi also supports waveform editing using mouse or keyboard as found in
typical audio applications.

Obi also has a cleanup operation which removes all unused audio data
throughout the project.

### Accessible VU meter

Obi provides a graphical VU meter used to monitor recording and playback
levels. It also provides a text-based VU meter that can work with screen
readers.

## Metadata editing

Obi supports editing of all DAISY metadata specified in the DAISY/NISO 2005
specification and allows the addition of custom metadata.

## Undo/redo

All operations within Obi can be undone or redone, including audio edits.

## User customization

Obi stores user profiles to help with metadata, as well as user preferences
such as audio settings or window sizes.

Color schemes and font sizes can be customized. Default color schemes such
as high contrast color scheme are provided.

## Search

All text content in a project (such as section titles or annotations) can be
searched and located.
