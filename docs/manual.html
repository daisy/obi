    <p>Now this is really the reference section. If you're a user and not a
developper, you can ignore the items marked as <span class="todo">TODO</span>.</p>
    <h2 id="id18409">Views</h2>
    <p>The work area of Obi is composed of several views, as described below. All
views (except for the strips view) can be shown or hidden as necessary.</p>
    <h3 id="id18418">Strips view</h3>
    <p>The main view is the <em>strips view</em>. This is the view in which the contents of
the book are edited. There is a strip for every section in the book and they
appear in book order in the strips view. Inside each strip the actual contents
appear as blocks.</p>
    <h4 id="id18433">Strips</h4>
    <p>A <em>strip</em> represents a section and its contents. Subsections are represented as
other strips that follow in the strip view. Contents are represented as blocks
which are shown in book order inside the strip. A strip fills the entire width
of the strips view and has two parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>an editable label showing the title of the section;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a sequence of zero or more blocks.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="id18461">Blocks</h4>
    <p>A <em>block</em> is used to represent an unit of content in the strips view. A block
can be empty or contain audio. The audio content of a block is called a
<em>phrase</em> as it allows for the reader to skip easily from phrase to phrase
when the book is exported to DAISY. Obi does not impose any limitations on
the amount of audio that a block may contain.</p>
    <h4 id="id18481">Different kinds of blocks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Empty blocks</em> are blocks that contain no audio. They can be used as
placeholders for adding audio at a later time. An empty block only contains
an information label. <span class="todo">TODO</span>: describe contents of label; something like "block
<em>n</em> of <em>m</em>."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Plain blocks</em> are blocks that contain audio. In addition to the information
label, the waveform of the audio is displayed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Page blocks</em> are blocks that represent a page number. The corresponding
phrase is usually a reading of the page number. An actual number is
associated with the block. Example: page number 42 in the book can be
represented by a page block bearing the number 42 and the phrase "page
42." In the exported DAISY book, a page block will be skippable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Silence blocks</em> are used for phrase detection; see below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Custom blocks</em> are blocks that have some additional property in the current
book (such as producer notes, side bars, etc.) These can be defined by the
producer of the book as needed. In the exported DAISY book, custom blocks
will be skippable.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> future versions of Obi will have <em>container blocks</em> that can hold
other blocks to create escapable structures, such as lists or audio tables,
but they are not included in the current release of Obi.</p>
    <h3 id="id18557">TOC view</h3>
    <p>The <em>table of contents view</em> (<em>TOC view</em> for short) shows the table of contents
of the book in a hierarchical way. Each entry in the table of contents is
called a <em>section</em>; this is a generic Obi term, and can be a book part,
chapter, section, subsection, etc. The level of each section is shown by its
indentation. As noted above, there is a corresponding strip for every section
in the TOC view.</p>
    <h3 id="id18580">Metadata view</h3>
    <p>The <em>metadata view</em> shows the metadata of the book: information such as title,
narrator, date of publication, etc. Metadata entries can be edited in this
view.</p>
    <h3 id="id18593">Transport bar and peak meter</h3>
    <p>The <em>transport bar</em> is used for recording and playback of the book. It has
buttons such as play, record, or stop; a time display; and a textual peak
meter. In addition to the transport bar, an external peak meter can also be
shown alongside Obi's main window.</p>
    <h2 id="id18608">Selection</h2>
    <p>All edits in Obi are based on the current selection. In the current version of
Obi, only a single selection can be made at once (future versions of Obi will
have multiple selection.)</p>
    <p class="indent">In general, selection is performed by clicking (and possibly dragging) on the
object or area to select; keyboard users can navigate to the desired region
to select (see keyboard navigation below.)</p>
    <h3 id="id18625">What is selectable?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the strips view:
<ul><li>A strip is selectable.</li><li>The label of a strip is selectable. When selected, the label becomes
editable.</li><li>A position inside a strip is selectable. The position can be before the
first block, after the last block, or between two blocks.</li><li>A block inside a strip is selectable.</li><li>The waveform in a block is selectable; either a position or a range of
audio.</li></ul></li>
      <li>In the TOC view:
<ul><li>A section is selectable.</li><li>The text label of a section is selectable. When selected, it becomes
editable.</li></ul></li>
      <li>In the metadata view:
<ul><li>A metadata entry in the metadata view is selectable (<span class="todo">TODO</span>).</li><li>The text inside a metadata entry is selectable (<span class="todo">TODO</span>). When selected, it
becomes editable.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id18689">Label editing</h3>
    <p>The label of a strip or a section, and the value of a metadata entry (<span class="todo">TODO</span>) can
be directly edited by clicking them. When typing <code>Enter</code>, the new name is
committed; typing <code>Esc</code> cancels the edit. Strips also have an <code>OK</code> and <code>Cancel</code>
button which achieve the same effects.</p>
    <h2 id="id18714">Transport bar and peak meter</h2>
    <h3 id="id18718">Transport bar buttons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Play button</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Space</code>): this button gives Play All command while
starting playback from currently selected block in strip view or currently
selected node in tree view.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is no in phrase selection, (technically  termed as audio
selection) this button starts playback from starting of selected block or
selected tree node.</li>
          <li>If there is Audio selection and cursor has a position marked inside
phrase, this button starts playback from this cursor position.</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: <code>Ctrl+Space</code> doesn't seem to work? And should play all;
<code>Ctrl+Shift+Space</code> to play selection (see menu)?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Pause button</strong> (<code>Space</code>): pause both playback as well as recording (which
ever is active). Pause position and cursor position are synchronised with
each other so pause position also acts as cursor position for operations
like split and insert recording.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Stop button</strong>: stop playback or recording which ever is active.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id18786">Peak meter</h3>
    <h2 id="id18789">Menus</h2>
    <h3 id="id18793">File menu (<code>Alt+F</code>)</h3>
    <p>Creating and opening projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>New project</strong> (<code>Ctrl+N</code>): create a new project. If there is a project
currently open, Obi will attempt to close it first. A dialog is shown where
the user can enter a title for the project and choose a location for saving
it. <span class="todo">TODO</span>: add instructions in the dialog.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>New project from import</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>): create a new project by
importing an XHTML file containing the structure of the project. You will
have to choose a title (if different from the one given in the file) and
a location for saving the project. <span class="todo">TODO</span>: better error handling (completely
undo the import.)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Missing commands)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean unreferenced audio</strong> (<code>Ctrl+L</code>): clean unreferenced audio from the
project. Obi keeps unused audio data so that changes can be undone, but
sometime there is audio data in the project that is not referenced anywhere
(<em>i.e.</em>, there is no phrase with this audio data, nor any command in the
undo stack that concerns this data.) In order to save disk space, it is
possible to clean the project by removing all this data. It is recommended
to save right after cleaning the project, otherwise there may be problems
when reopening the project. Cleaning the project at the beginning of the
session makes sure that all of the data not referenced in the project itself
has been removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id18867">Edit menu (<code>Alt+E</code>)</h3>
    <p>Obi stores all executed commands in an <em>undo stack</em> so that commands can be
undone later. All commands executed since the current project was loaded are
stored so an unlimited number of commands can be undone. Undone commands are
also stored in a <em>redo stack</em> so that an undone command can be redone. Whenever
a new command is executed, the redo stack is cleared.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Undo</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Z</code>): undo the last executed command.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: save the undo stack in the XUK file.</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: when the project reverts to the last saved state, mark it as
unmodified.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Redo</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Y</code>): redo the last undone command.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obi maintains a clipboard that contains the last cut or copied item. Undoing a
cut or copy operation restores the previous value of the clipboard.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Cut</strong> (<code>Ctrl+X</code>): delete the selected item (strip, section, block or audio)
and place it in the clipboard. <span class="todo">TODO</span>: works for text as well, but only through
shortcut; not well integrated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Copy</strong> (<code>Ctrl+C</code>): copy the selected item (strip, section, block or audio)
and place it in the clipboard. <span class="todo">TODO</span>: works for text as well, but only through
shortcut; not well integrated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Paste</strong> (<code>Ctrl+V</code>): paste the item from the clipboard in or after the
selection.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the clipboard contains a section node, it can be pasted after the
selected section in the TOC view or the selected strip in the strip view.</li>
          <li>If the clipboard contains a block, it can be pasted after the selected
block, at the end of the selected strip, or at the selection point inside
a strip. If the selection is a waveform cursor, then the audio of the block
is inserted at that point; if it is a waveform selection, then the audio
of the block is pasted in place of the selection.</li>
          <li>If the clipboard contains audio, the audio can be pasted as a new block
in the selected strip or at the selected point inside a strip, or at the
end of the selected block. If the selection is a waveform cursor, then the
audio is inserted at that point; if it is a waveform selection, then the
audio is pasted in place of the selection.</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: text, yada yada.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Paste before</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Alt+V</code>): when a section is selected and a section is
in the clipboard, paste the section from the clipbaord before the selected
section and at the same level.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Paste inside</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code>): when a section is selected and a section
is in the clipboard, paste the section from the clipboard as a subsection of
the selected section. The child is added last.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Delete</strong> (<code>Del</code>): delete the selected item. If it is a section, then all
subsections are deleted as well. If it is a strip, then only this strip is
deleted. If the corresponding section has subsection, the first subsection
is moved to the level of the deleted section so that the consistency of the
TOC is preserved.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Select nothing</strong> (<code>Alt+N</code>): deselect any item that was selected.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: change the keyboard shortcut.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to cleaning up unreferenced audio data, it is possible to also
clean up <em>unused</em> data from the project.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delete unused data</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+L</code>): delete all sections and phrases
marked as being unused. This can be undone, just like any deletion in Obi.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Athough Obi is an audio editing tool, a large project can still contain a non
trivial amount of text (section headings, metadata, annotations) so a search
function is provided.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Find</strong> (<code>F3</code>): bring the search bar in focus and let the user type some
text to find. The first item containing this text is selected (in the case
of section titles, the strip corresponding to the section is selected.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: quick find with <code>/</code> as in <code>vi</code>.</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: search metadata.</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: buttons in the search bar (previous, next?)</li>
          <li><span class="todo">TODO</span>: replace?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="id19174">TOC menu (<code>Alt+C</code>)</h3>
    <p>The TOC menu provides operations on the table of contents.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add section</strong> (<code>Ctrl+A</code>): add a new section after the selected section
and at the same level. If no section is selected, then add a new section at
the top level and at the end.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Ad sub-section</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+A</code>): add a new section as the last child of
the selected section.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Insert section</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Alt+A</code>): insert a new section before the selected
section and at the same level.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Rename section</strong> (<code>F2</code>): start editing the label of the section. The new
name cannot be empty. The change is committed when pressing <code>Return</code> or
cancelled when pressing <code>Esc</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Move section in</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+Left</code>): increase the level of the section
by one. The section becomes the first subsection of its previous sibling
section; as a consequence, the first subsection of a section cannot be
moved in. Only the section moves, not its subsections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Move section out</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+Right</code>): decrease the level of the section
by one. Only sections without subsections can be moved out. Top-level
sections can obviously not be moved out.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Section is used</strong> (<code>Ctrl+K</code>): when a section is selected, the menu
item shows whether the section is used or not with a checkbox. The checkbox
is checked if the section is currently used. Selecting this item toggles the
used status of the section (from used to unused, and from unused to used.)
When the used status of the section changes, all subsections change to the
same status as well. The status of a section can only be changed if its
parent section is used (or if it is a top-level section), as there cannot
be used subsections of unused sections.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="id19281">Strips menu (<code>Alt+S</code>)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add strip</strong> (<code>Ctrl+A</code>): add a new strip after the selected strip. The
corresponding section will be at the same level as the section of the
selected strip. If the section of the selected strip had subsections, they
become subsections of the new section.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Insert strip</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Alt+A</code>): insert a new strip before the selected
strip.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Rename strip</strong> (<code>F2</code>): start editing the label of the strip. The new name
cannot be empty. The change is committed when pressing <code>Return</code> or cancelled
when pressing <code>Esc</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Split strip</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>): split the strip at the selected position
in the strip, or from the selected block. The new strip has the same label
and level as the original strip, and all the blocks starting from the split
position. If the first block or position is selected, there is no effect.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Merge strip with next</strong> (<code>Ctrl+Shift+M</code>): merge the selected strip with the
next one; that is, all the blocks in the following strip are appended to the
selected strip. The following strip is then removed from the project. If the
following strip has a lower level than the selected strip, merging is not
possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Strip is used</strong> (<code>Ctrl+K</code>): when a strip is selected, the menu
item shows whether the strip is used or not with a checkbox. The checkbox
is checked if the strip is currently used. Selecting this item toggles the
used status of the strip (from used to unused, and from unused to used.)
This operation can only be executed if the corresponding section has no
subsection; <em>i.e.</em> if the operation affects only the selected strip. The
contents of the strip are affected as well.</p>

with a page number.  A dialog opens where the user can choose the page
number for the first block, the number of blocks to add, and whether to
renumber subsequent page blocks automatically. The page number increases by
one for each block (<em>e.g.</em> if three pages are added starting at page number
4, the three page blocks will be numbered 4, 5 and 6) and for subsequent
pages if the user chooses to renumber them (<em>e.g.</em> following pages would be
renumbered 7, 8, 9, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
