# Obi documentation

Please keep this file up-to-date and link to available documents with a
brief description. Here is what we have so far:

* [Blocks](blocks.html): A taxonomy of Obi blocks.

* [Events](events.html): "This document describes Obi's eventing and summarizes how to introduce new features in the application."

* [Menus](menus.txt): list of menu shortcuts and accelerator keys.

* [Metadata](metadata.txt): list of required metadata for Z. Obi needs to
implement those :(

* [Obi](obi.html): describes the application itself.

* [Playback](playback.html): playback behavior.

* [Reference](reference.txt): the reference manual. Needs a new revision.

* [Release notes](release-notes.txt): release notes for Obi. Needs a new
revision when we make a major new release.

* [Strip manager shortcuts](strip_manager_shortcuts.html): as the name
implies. Review those as part of the new requirements.

* [Task list](tasklist.html): task list for version 1.0.

* [Testing](testing.txt): instructions for testers.
