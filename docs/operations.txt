## Sections

This replaces the TOC menu.

* __Hide/show TOC__: hide or show the table of contents panel.
* __Insert section__: insert a sibling section before the selected section.
  * Should become __Add section__ and append, whatever the context. There is
  no way then to add a section at the front, has to be moved. Oh well.
* __Add sub-section__: add a section as last child of the selected section.
* __Move section out__: decrease the level of the selected section by one.
* __Move section in__: increase the level of the selected section by one.
* __Mark section as used/unused__: the section (and subsections) is now used
or unused.
  * __Include/Exclude section__ would work better?
* __Show in strip view__: show the corresponding section strip.

### Navigation lists

* Navlist stuff should get its own menu, but this is related to the TOC.

### Pages

* Pages may come here?
  * Add/remove page number to a block
  * Go to page
  * Renumber from this page (renumber sequentially from the currently
  selected page, or the first of a multiple selection...)

## Strips

This replaces the strips part of the strips menu.

* __Insert strip__: insert a strip before the currently selected strip.
  * Should become __Add strip__ just like add section in the Sections menu.
  The corresponding section is a sibling of the previous strip's section.
* __Rename strip__: change the label of the selected strip.
* __Show in Sections view__: show the corresponding section.

TODO:

* Add image/remove image: the image that goes in the NCX. A thumbnail is
shown in the view?

## Audio blocks

This replaces the audio block part of the strips menu.

* __Import audio files__: create new audio blocks from imported files.
  * Append instead of insert.
  * Can import into empty block.
* __Split audio block__: split the selected audio block in two by bringing
up the split dialog.
* __Quick split audio block__: split the block at the currently playing
position (without bringing up a dialog.)
* __Apply phrase detection__: apply phrase detection to the selected block.
* __Merge with previous audio block__: merge two audio blocks.
  * This may become merge with next block (more consistent with append)
  * This may become "merge blocks" and necessitate the selection of several
  blocks.
* __Move audio block forward/backward__: move the audio block in the given
direction.
  * Necessary if paste is always "paste after".
  * Should drag with mouse as well.
  * Applies to several blocks.
